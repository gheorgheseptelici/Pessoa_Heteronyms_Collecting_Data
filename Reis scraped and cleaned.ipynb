       " 'Each thing in its time has its time The trees do not blossom in winter Nor does the white cold Cover the ﬁelds in spring The heat that the day required of us Belongs not to the night thats falling Lydia Lets love with greater calm Our uncertain life Sitting by the ﬁre weary not from our work But because its the hour for weariness Lets not force our voice To be more than a secret And may our words of reminiscence Which is all the suns black departure brings us Be spoken at intervals Haphazardly Lets remember the past by degrees And may the stories told back then Now twicetold stories Speak to us Of the ﬂowers that in our distant childhood We picked with another kind of pleasure And another consciousness As we gazed at the world And so Lydia sitting there by the ﬁre As if there forever like household gods Lets mend the past As if mending clothes In the disquiet that repose must bring to our lives When all we do is think of what We were and outside Theres just night   ',\n",
       " 'THE CHESS PLAYERS Ive heard that once during I dont know What war of Persia When invaders rampaged through the City And the women screamed Two chess players kept on playing Their endless game In the shade of a leafy tree they stared At the old chessboard And next to each player was a mug of wine Solemnly ready To quench his thirst in the moments when Having made his move He could sit back and relax waiting On his opponent Houses were burning walls were torn down And coffers plundered Women were raped and propped against The crumbling walls Children pierced by spears were so much Blood in the streets But the two chess players stayed where they were Close to the city And far from its clamor and kept on playing Their game of chess Even if in the bleak winds messages They heard the screams And upon reﬂection knew in their hearts That surely their women And their tender daughters were being raped In the nearby distance Even if in the moment they thought this A ﬂeeting shadow Passed over their hazy oblivious brows Soon their calm eyes Returned with conﬁdent attention To the old chessboard When the ivory kings in danger who cares About the ﬂesh and blood Of sisters and mothers and little children When the rook cant cover The retreat of the white queen what Does pillaging matter And when with sure hand the opponents king Is placed in check It hardly concerns ones soul that children Are dying in the distance Even if the infuriated face Of an invading warrior Should suddenly peer over the wall and cause The solemn chess player To fall right there in a bloody heap The moment before that Was still devoted to the favorite game Of the supremely indifferent Let cities fall and people suffer Let life and freedom Perish let secure ancestral properties Be burned and uprooted But when war interrupts the game make sure The kings not in check And the most advanced of the ivory pawns Is ready to redeem the rook My brothers in loving Epicurus And in understanding him More in accord with our view than with his Lets learn from the story Of the impassive chess players how To spend our lives Let serious things scarcely matter to us And grave things weigh little And let the natural drive of instincts yield To the futile pleasure In the peaceful shade of the trees Of playing a good game Whatever we take from this useless life Be it glory or fame Love science or life itself Its worth no more Than the memory of a wellplayed game And a match won Against a better player Glory weighs like an overlarge burden And fame like a fever Love wearies for it ardently searches Science never ﬁnds And life grieves for it knows it is passing The game of chess Completely absorbs ones heart but weighs little When lost for its nothing Ah in the shade that unconsciously loves us And with a mug of wine At our side intent only on the useless Effort of the chess game Even if the game is only a dream And we have no partner Lets do as the Persians of this story Wherever out there Near or faraway war and our country And life are calling us Let them call in vain while we dream In the friendly shade Of our partners and the chess game dreams Of its indifference   ',\n",
