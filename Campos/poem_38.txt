I took off the mask and looked in the mirror. I was the same child I was years ago. I hadn’t changed at all... That’s the advantage of knowing how to remove your mask. You’re still the child, The past that lives on, The child. I took off the mask, and I put it back on. It’s better this way. This way I’m the mask. And I return to normality as to a streetcar terminus.
