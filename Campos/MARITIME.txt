  Alone this summer morning on the deserted wharf I look toward the bar I look toward the Indeﬁnite I look and am glad to see The tiny black ﬁgure of an incoming steamer Its still far away but distinct classic in its own way It leaves a useless trail of smoke in the air far behind it Its coming in and the morning with it and here and there Along the river maritime life begins to stir Sails are hoisted tugboats advance Small boats jut out from behind the anchored ships Theres a slight breeze But my soul is with what I least see The incoming steamer Because its with the Distance with Morning With the maritime meaning of this Hour With the sweet pain that rises in me like a queasiness Like the onset of seasickness but in my soul I look at the faroff steamer with great independence of mind And in me a ﬂywheel slowly starts spinning The steamers coming in around the bar in the morning Bring to my eyes The happy and sad mystery of all who arrive and depart They bring memories of distant wharfs and other moments Of another sort of the same humanity in other ports Every landing and every sailing of a ship IsI feel it in me like my own blood Unconsciously symbolic terribly Fraught with metaphysical meanings That stir up in me the man I once was Ah every wharf is a nostalgia made of stone And when the ship shoves off And we suddenly notice a space widening Between the wharf and the ship Then Im hit by a fresh anxiety I cant explain A mist of sad feelings Glistening in the sun of my grassy anxieties Like the ﬁrst dawnlit window And it wraps me as if it were someone elses remembrance Now mysteriously mine Ah who knows who knows If I didnt already set sail from a wharf A long time ago before I ever wasif I a ship In the slanting light of dawn Didnt already depart from another kind of port Who knows if long before the outer world as I know it Dawned for me I didnt already depart From a large wharf full of a few people From a large halfawakened city From a huge commercial overgrown and apoplectic city As far as this is possible outside of Space and Time Yes from a wharf a wharf in some sense material Real with the form of a wharf a wharf in fact The Absolute Wharf whose model weve unconsciously imitated Unwittingly evoked to build Our wharfs that serve our ports Our wharfs of literal stone over actual water And once theyre built they strike us without warning as Real Things Spirit Things SoulStone Beings At certain moments of root feeling When a door in the outer world seems to open And without anything changing Everything proves to be different Ah the Great Wharf from where we set sail in NationShips O Great Primordial Wharf eternal and divine Of what port Over what waters And why do I wonder Great Wharf like other wharfs but the only One Rustling like them with predawn silences And blossoming with morning to the noise of cranes And arriving freight trains Under an occasional thin black cloud Of smoke from nearby factories That shades the black and shiny coalsprinkled ground Like the shadow of a cloud passing over dusky waters Ah what essence of mystery and senses arrested In revelatory divine ecstasy At hours colored by silence and anxieties Forms the bridge between any wharf and The Wharf Wharf blackly reﬂected in still waters The bustle on board ships O wandering restless soul of people who live in ships Of symbolic people who come and go and for whom nothing lasts For when the ship returns to port Theres always some change on board O neverending ﬂights departures drunkenness from Diversity Eternal soul of navigators and navigations Hulls slowly mirrored in the water As the ship pulls out of port To ﬂoat like lifes soul to sally forth like a voice To live the moment gently tossing on eternal waters To wake up to days more immediate than Europes To see mysterious ports bordering the seas solitude To round faroff capes and ﬁnd sudden vast landscapes Of countless startled slopes Ah the distant beaches the wharfs seen from afar And then the beaches close up the wharfs in plain view The mystery of every departure and every arrival The sad instability and inscrutability Of this impossible universe Felt more deeply in the skin with each passing maritime hour Our souls absurd sobbing Over the expanses of diverse seas with isles in the distance Over the distant islands ﬂanking the coasts not visited Over the ports that grow clearer with their houses and people As the ship approaches Ah how fresh the mornings of arrivals are And how pallid the mornings of departures When our insides tighten into a ball And a vague sensation akin to fear The ancestral fear of leaving what we know and going away The mysterious ancestral fear of Arrival and the New Makes us shrink in our skin with anxiety And the whole of our anguished body as if it were our soul Feels an inexplicable desire to feel all this In some other way Theres a nostalgia for something A stirring of affection but for what uncertain country What coast What ship What wharf The thought languishes And were left with a large inner void A hollow satiety of seaborne minutes And a vague anxiety that would be weariness or sorrow If it knew how to be either Even so the summer morning is slightly cool A slight torpor of night still wafts in the shaken air The ﬂywheel in me spins a bit faster And the steamer is coming in because I know it must be coming And not because I can see it moving at such a great distance In my imagination its already close by and visible All up and down its rows of portholes And everything in me trembles all my muscles and ﬂesh Because of that person who never arrives in any boat And whom Ive come to wait for today because of an oblique command The ships coming in around the bar The ships setting out from ports The ships passing in the ofﬁng I imagine myself watching them from a deserted beach All these abstract ships about to depart All these ships move me as if they were more Than mere ships ships coming and going And ships seen from up close even if were not going to embark on them Seen from below from the skiffs next to the steel broadsides Seen from inside in the cabins the lounges the storerooms Seeing up close the masts tapering high overhead Brushing against the ropes descending the cramped stairways Smelling the greasy metallic and maritime mixture of all this Ships seen from up close are something else and are the same Stirring the same nostalgia and the same yearning in another way The seafaring life All that it embraces and all that it is All of its sweet seduction ﬁlters into my blood And I daydream indeﬁnitely of voyages The distant coastlines ﬂattened by the horizon The capes islands and sandy beaches The maritime solitudes like certain moments in the Paciﬁc When by the power of some suggestion learned in school Our nerves feel the weight of its being the largest ocean And the world and the taste of things become a desert in us The splashier more human expanse of the Atlantic The Indian Ocean the most mysterious of all And the Mediterranean without mystery soft and classical a sea that washes Esplanades eyed by white statues in nearby gardens How Id love to hold all seas all straits all bays and all gulfs Against my chest feel them close and die And you O nautical things my old dream toys Be my inner life outside me Keels masts and sails helms rigging Smokestacks propellers topsails pennants Tiller ropes hatchways boilers pipes and valves Fall inside of me in a heap one big heap Like the jumbled contents of a drawer dumped out on the ﬂoor Be the treasure of my feverish greed Be the fruit of the tree of my imagination Theme of my songs blood in the v eins of my intellect The aesthetic link between me and the outside Provide me with metaphors images literature Because really and truly seriously literally My sensations are a boat with its keel in the air My imagination a halfsunken anchor My yearning a broken oar And the web of my nerves a net left to dry on the beach Somewhere on the river a single whistle blows The entire ground of my psyche is now trembling The ﬂywheel in me keeps moving faster Ah the steamers the voyages the notknowingthe whereabouts Of soandso a seaman of our acquaintance Ah the glory of knowing that a man who palled around with us Was drowned off an island in the Paciﬁc We who knew him will tell this to everyone With all due pride and a quiet conviction That all this has a broader and more beautiful meaning Than just the loss of the ship on which he sailed And his sinking to the bottom with his lungs full of water Ah the steamers the coal ships the sailing ships How rare alas sailing ships are becoming on the high seas I who love modern civilization and kiss machines with all my soul I the engineer and sophisticate who studied abroad Would love to see once again only wooden ships and sailing vessels To know no other seafaring life besides the ancient life of the seas For the ancient seas are Absolute Distance The Pure Faraway free of the weight of Today Ah how everything here reminds me of that better life Of those seas that were larger since navigation was slower Of those seas that were mysterious since no one knew much about them Every faraway steamer is a nearby sailing ship Every distant ship seen now is a ship from the past seen up close All the invisible sailors aboard ships on the horizon Are visible sailors from the time of the old vessels From the slow saildriven age of perilous voyages From the wood and canvas age of voyages that took months The delirium of maritime things slowly takes hold of me The wharf and its atmosphere physically penetrate me The surging of the Tagus inundates my senses And I begin to dream to be wrapped by the dream of the wat ers  The transmission belts on my soul start turning hard And Im visibly shaken by the ﬂywheels increasing speed The waters call me The oceans call me The faraway calls me with a bodily voice And its every seafaring age there ever was calling It was you Jim Barnes English sailor and my friend Who taught me that ancient English cry Which so virulently sums up For complex souls like mine The confused call of the waters The uncanny implicit voice of all maritime things Of shipwrecks of long voyages of dangerous crossings That English cry of yours which in my blood becomes universal A cry like no other without human form or voice That tremendous cry which seems to resound Inside a cavern whose roof is the sky And seems to tell all the sinister things That can happen in the Faraway on the Sea at Night You always pretended to be calling a schooner Cupping your large dark and weathered hands On the sides of your mouth to make a megaphone crying Ahoooooooo oooyyyy Schooner ahoooooooooooooyyyy  I can hear you from here now and I wake up to something The wind shudders The morning rises The heat sets in I feel my cheeks redden My conscious eyes dilate Ecstasy stirs increases ascends in me And with a blind riotous hum The ﬂywheels restless spinning intensiﬁes O clamorous call Whose heat and fury make all my yearnings Seethe in one explosive ensemble And even my tediumsall of thembecome dynamic An appeal made to my blood By an old love from I dont know where that returns With still enough strength to allure and pull me With still enough power to make me hate this life I live amidst the physical and psychic impermeability Of the real people all around me Ah to depart By whatever means and to whatever place To set out across the waves across unknown perils across the sea To go Far to go Wide toward Abstract Distance Indeﬁnitely through deep and mysterious nights Carried like dust by the winds by the gales To go go go once and for all All of my blood lusts for wings All of my body lurches forward I rush through my imagination in torrents I trample myself underfoot I growl I hurtle My yearnings burst into foam And my ﬂesh is a wave crashing into cliffs Thinking about thisO rage Thinking about thisO fury Thinking about the smallness of my life full of yearnings Suddenly tremulously extraorbitally With a vicious vast and violent rocking Of the restless ﬂywheel of my imagination The dark and sadistic libido of the strident maritime life Breaks out of me whistling hooting and raving Hey sailors lookouts Hey shipmates pilots Navigators seamen mariners adventurers Hey ship captains Hey men at the helm and on the masts Men who sleep on wooden bunks Men who sleep with Danger peeking through the portholes Men who sleep with Death for a pillow Men who have decks and bridges from where they can gaze Upon the vast vastness of the vast sea Hey crane operators Hey sail trimmers stokers cabin boys Men who load cargo in the holds Men who coil ropes on deck Men who polish the hardware of the hatches Men at the helm men on the engines men on the masts Heyeyeyeyeyeyey Men with peaked caps Men in mesh undershirts Men with anchors and crossed ﬂags embroidered on their chests Tattooed men Men with pipes Men on the gunwales Swarthy from so much sun shriveled from so much rain Cleareyed from so much vastness all around them Boldfaced from so much wind having pounded them Heyeyeyeyeyeyey Men whove seen Patagonia Men whove been to Australia Men whove feasted your eyes on coasts Ill never see Whove landed in lands where Ill never set foot Who bought primitive goods in colonies at the fore of hinterlands And you did all of this as if it were nothing As if this were natural As if life were simply this As if you werent even fulﬁlling a destiny Heyeyeyeyeyeyey Men of todays ocean Men of yesterdays ocean Pursers Galley slaves Combatants at Lepanto Pirates from Roman times Mariners from Greece Phoenicians Carthaginians Portuguese launched from Sagres Into an uncertain adventure onto the Absolute Sea to achieve the Impossible Heyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyey Men who erected stone pillars and gave names to capes Men who traded for the ﬁrst time with black people Who ﬁrst sold slaves from new lands Who bestowed the ﬁrst European spasm on startled Negro women Who brought back gold beads fragrant woods arrows From hillsides bursting with lush vegetation Men who pillaged peaceful African villages Who put the natives to ﬂight with booming cannons Who killed who robbed who tortured who won The reward of New Things for rushing headlong Into the mystery of new seas Heyeyeyeyey I salute all of you in one man and one man in all of you All of you mixed together all intermingled All of you bloody violent hated feared fabled I salute you I salute you I salute you Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyeyeyeyeyey HeylaohlaohlaOHlaahahahahah I want to go with you I want to go with you With all of you at the same time To every place youve been I want to meet headon the same dangers you met To feel on my face the winds that withered yours To spit from my lips the salt of the seas that kissed yours To help swab your decks to be with you in storms To arrive like you ﬁnally at extraordinary ports To ﬂee with you from civilization To lose with you all sense of morality To feel my humanity change in faraway places To drink with you in southern seas New savageries new tumults in my soul New central ﬁres in my volcanic spirit To go with you to take off Get the hell out of here My civilized mans suit my mildmannered ways My congenital fear of chains and fetters My peaceful life My seated static orderly and repetitive life To the sea the sea the sea the sea Ah throw my life to the wind to the waves To the sea Salt with windblown foam My taste for great voyages Thrash with whipping water the ﬂesh of my adventure Douse with the cold depths the bones of my existence Scourge cut and shrivel with winds foams and suns My cyclonic Atlantic being My nerves stretched out like taut shrouds A lyre in the hands of the winds Yes yes yes C rucify me on your ocean crossings And my shoulders will revel in my cross Tie me to your voyages as if to stakes And the sensation of the stakes will enter through my spine And Ill feel them in a vast passive ecstasy Do what you like with me as long as its at sea On ship decks to the sound of waves Wound me rip me open kill me All I want is to take to Death A soul overﬂowing with Sea Drunk silly on maritime things On sailors as well as on anchors ropes On distant coasts as well as on the winds howling On the Faraway as well as on the Wharf on shipwrecks As well as on peaceful trade operations On masts as well as on the waves To take to Deathin voluptuous pain A body covered with leeches sucking away Covered with strange absurd green sea leeches Make shrouds out of my veins Hawsers out of my muscles Flay my skin and nail it to the keels And let me feel the pain of the nails and never stop feeling it Make my heart into an admirals ﬂag On a ship of old in time of war Yank out my eyes and grind them into the deck with your feet Smash my bones against the gunwales Tie me to the masts and thrash me thrash me To all the winds of all latitudes and longitudes Spill my blood over the r aging waters That sweep across the poop deck In the storms wild convulsions To have the audacity of sailcloth in the wind To be like the topsails the whistling of the winds An old guitar playing a fado about seas rife with dangers A song for sailors to hear and not repeat The sailors who mutinied Hung the captain from a sail yard Another they left on a desert isle Marooned The sun of the tropics has made my taut veins seethe With the fever of oldtime piracy The winds of Patagonia have tattooed my imagination With tragic and obscene images Fire ﬁre ﬁre inside me Blood blood blood blood My brain is bursting The world as I know it explodes in red My veins snap with the sound of cables And from deep within booms the savage and insatiable Song of the Great Pirate The bellowing death of the Great Pirate whose singing Sends a chill down the spine of his men Astern he dies howling his song Fifteen men on a dead mans chest Yohoho and a bottle of rum And then yells in a blasting unreal voice Darby MGrawawawawaw Darby MGrawawawawawawawaw Fetch aaaft the ruuuuuuuuuum Darby Ah what a life what a life that was Heyeyeyeyeyeyey HeylaohlaohlaOHlaahahahahah Heyeyeyeyeyeyey Split keels sunken ships blood on the seas Decks awash in blood sectioned corpses Severed ﬁngers left lying on gunwales Heads of children here and there People with gouged eyes shouting screaming Heyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyey Heyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyey I bundle up in all this as in a cloak when its cold I rub against all this like a cat in heat against a wall I roar for all this like a famished lion I rush at all this like a crazed bull I dig my nails into this break my claws on it and chew it till my teeth bleed Heyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyey Suddenly I hear the old cry Now harsh angry metallic Like a bugle blasting at my side Calling the sighted prey The schooner thats going to be seized Ahoooooooooooyyyy Schooner ahoooooooooooooyyyy The World has ceased to exist for me Im burning red I roar in fury for the attack Pirate chief Pirate Caesar I plunder kill rip slash All I feel is the sea the prey the pillage All I feel within are the veins of my temples Beating and beating me The sensation of my eyes is bleeding hot blood Heyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyey Ah pirates pirates pirates Love me and hate me pirates Take me into your midst pirates How your rage and cruelty speak to the blood Of a womans body that once was mine and whose lust has survived Id love to be an animal that would embody all your acts That would sink its teeth into the hulls and keels That would eat masts drink blood and tar on ship decks Chew sails oars ropes and pulleys A monstrous female seaserpent gorging on your crimes And theres a symphony of incompatible and analogous sensations An orchestration in my blood of deafe ning crimes Of convulsive clamors from bloody orgies on the high sea All raging like a torrid gale through my mind A cloud of hot dust obscuring my perception So that I see and dream all this with my skin and veins only Pirates piracy vessels and the hour The maritime hour when prey are captured And the terror of the captured escapes into madness that hour With all its crimes terror vessels people sea sky clouds Breezes latitude longitude shouting voices Id like the Whole of this to be the Whole of my body suffering To be my body and my blood to form the stuff of my being in red To thrive like an itching wound in my souls unreal ﬂesh Ah to be everything in every crime To be all the component parts Of raids on ships of slaughters and rapes To be whatever was on the spot where pillages occurred To be whatever lived or was left dead on the site of gory tragedies To be the sumtotalpirate of all piracy at its zenith And the ﬂeshandblood synthesis of all pirate victims in the world To be in my passive body the womanallwomen Ever raped killed cut and mauled by pirates To be in my submissive self the female who needs to be theirs And to feel all thisall these things all at oncerunning down my spine O my hairy and gruff heroes of adventure and crime My seafaring brutes husbands of my imagination Casual lovers of my oblique sensations I long to be That Woman who waits for you in ports For you heinous men she loves in dreams with her pirate blood For she would rage with you though only in spirit Over the naked corpses of your victims at sea For she would be with you in your crimes and in your oceanic orgy Her witchs spirit would invisibly dance around each movement Of your bodies your cutlasses your strangling hands On land she would wait for you and when you came if you came In your loves roaring she would drink all the vast Foggy and sinister perfume of your conquests And as you convulsed in ecstasy she would whistle a red and yellow sabbat Flesh torn bodies cut open and gutted the blood sp urting Now as my dream of your deeds reaches its climax I lose myself completely I stop belonging to you I am you My femininity is not just to be with you its to be your very souls To be inside all your brutality at the time you wreaked it To imbibe deep down your consciousness of what you felt When you tinged the high sea with blood When now and then you tossed to the sharks The still living bodies of the wounded and the pink ﬂesh of children And you dragged their mothers to the deck rails to look at what happened to them To be with you in your carnage and plundering To be harmonized with you in the symphony of your pillages Ah how much and in how many ways Id like to be yours To be not only your woman not only your women not only your victims Not only your victimized men women children and ships To be not only that hour and the vessels and the waves Not only your souls your bodies your rage your property To be not only the abstract orgy of your deeds in my physical self Not only this Id like to be more than thisthe God thats all this Id have to be God the God of an inverted faith A monstrous and satanic God the God of a bloodbased pantheism To be able to ﬁll up every cranny of my imaginative fury And never exhaust my desire to identify With the each and the all and the morethanall of your conquests Ah torture me to cure me Let my ﬂesh be the air your cutlasses slice Before they fall on heads and necks Let my veins be the clothes your knives rip right through My imagination the body of the women you rape My mind the deck you stand on while killing My entire lifein its nervous hysterical absurd ensemble The great organism in which every act of piracy ever committed Would be a conscious cell and all of me would spin As a huge rocking putridity embodying all of this The feverish machine of my teeming visions Now spins at such frightening inordinate speed That my ﬂywheel consciousness Is just a blurry circle whirring in the air Fifteen men on a dead mans chest Yohoho and a bottle of rum HeylaohlaohlaOHl aahahahahahahahah Ah the savagery of this savagery To hell With every life like ours which has none of this Look at me an engineer Necessarily practical sensitive to everything Static in comparison to you even when I walk Inert even when I act weak even when I assert myself Stagnant shattered a fainthearted renegade of your Glory Of your shrill hot and bloody dyna mic Damn my inability to turn my delirium into action Damn my always hanging on to civilizations apron strings Damn the dainty manners I carry on my back like a bale of lace Errand boys of modern humanitarianismthats what we all are A sorry lot of consumptives neurasthenics and phlegmatics Without the courage to be violent and daring men Our souls tied up like a chicken by the leg Ah pirates pirates The yearning for lawlessness coupled with brutality The yearning for absolutely cruel and abominable things Gnawing like an abstract lust at our delicate bodies At our squeamish and effeminate nerves And bringing mad fevers into our empty gazes Make me kneel down before you Beat and humiliate me Make me your slave and your plaything And dont ever deprive me of your contempt O my masters O my lords To always gloriously take the submissive part In bloody deeds and endless sensualities Fall on me like massive walls O barbarians of the ancient sea Rip me and wound me Streak my body with blood From east to west Kiss with cutlasses whips and rage My blissful carnal fear of belonging to you My masochistic yearning to submit to your fury To be the sentient impassive object of your omnivorous cruelty Rulers lords emperors pirates Ah torture me Rip me apart And once Ive been hacked into conscious pieces Strew me over the decks Scatter me across the waters leave me On the voracious beaches of islands Satiate in me all my mysticism of you Engrave my soul in blood Cut and slash O tattooers of my bodily imagination Beloved ﬂayers of my ﬂeshly submission Subdue me like a dog thats kicked to death Make me the vessel of your lordly disdain Make me all your victims As Christ suffered for all men I want to suffer For all whove been victims at your hands Your callused and bloody han ds with ﬁngers lopped off In sudden attacks at the gunwales Make me into something thats dragged O pleasure O beloved pain As if behind horses whipped by you But all this at sea at seeeea at  Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyeyeyeyeyey   At  Yeyeyeyeyeyey Yeyeyeyeyeyey Yeyeyeyeyeyey eyey Everything shouts out Every last thing shouts Winds waves boats Seas topsails pirates my heart blood and the air the air Heyeyeyey Yeyeyeyeyey Yeyeyeyeyeyey Everything shouts out in song   ON A      A  OF  Heyeyeyeyeyeyey Heyeyeyeyeyeyey Heyeyeyey eyeyey HeylaohlaohlaOHOOoolaahahahahahah AHOOOOOOOOOOOyyy   yyy Darby MGrawawawawawaw        Heyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyey     Something in me snaps The red has turned to dusk I felt too much to be able to keep on feeling My soul is spent only an echo in me remains The ﬂywheel is slowing down My dreams lift their hands a bit from my eyes Theres nothing in me but a void a desert a nocturnal sea And as soon as I feel this nocturnal sea in me Then again yet again from out of the silence Of its endless distance the vast and ageold cry arises Like a lightning ﬂash of soundsoothing not noisy Suddenly encompassing all the wet maritime Horizon and dark human surging in the night Like the voice of a distant siren weeping calling it rises From the depths of the Far the depths of the Sea the heart of the Abyss And on the surface like seaweed ﬂoat my broken dreams Ahoooooooooooy y Schooner ahoooooooooooooy y Ah the freshness of dew on my exhilaration The coolness of night on my inner ocean Everything in me suddenly beholds a night at sea Full of the vast and utterly human mystery of the nocturnal waves The moon rises on the horizon And my happy childhood wells up in me like a tear My past resurfaces as if that mariners cry Were a scent a voice the echo of a song Calling up from my past That happiness Ill never again know It was in the old peaceful house by the river My bedroom windows like the dining room windows Looked out over some lowlying houses and just beyond them the river The Tagus this very same Tagus but at a point further down If today I gazed out the same windows I wouldnt gaze out the same windows That time has passed like smoke from a steamer on the high sea An inexplicable feeling of tenderness A tearful and heartfelt remorse For all those victims especially the children I dreamed of hurting when I dreamed I was a pirate of old A feeling of regret since they were my victims A soft and tender feeling since they werent really A confused emotion bluish like a fogged window Sings old songs in my poor grieving heart Ah how could I think or dream those things How far I am from what I was a few minutes ago What hysterical feelingsﬁrst one thing then the opposite As the blond morning rises funny how my ears hear only Things that concur with this emotionthe lapping of the waters The river waters gentle lapping against the wharf  The sailboat passing along the rivers far shore The distant Japaneseblue hills The houses of Almada And whatevers soft and childlike in the early morning hours A seagull passes by And my tenderness increases But all this time I wasnt paying any attention All those things I felt were only skindeep like a caress All this time I never took my eyes off my distant dream My house by the river My childhood by the river My bedroom windows looking out onto the river at night And the peace of the moonlight scattered over the waters My old aunt who loved me because of the son shed lost My old aunt used to sing me to sleep Even though I was already too old for this The memory makes tears fall on my heart cleansing it of life And a light sea breeze wafts inside me Sometimes she sang The Good Ship Catrineta There goes the Catrineta Over the waves of the sea And at other times it was The Fair Princess with its wistful Medieval melody    I recall this and her poor old voice rises in me Reminding me how little Ive thought of her since then and she loved me so much How ungrateful Ive been to herand what have I done with my life Yes The Fair Princess    Id close my eyes as she sang The Fair Princess Sat in her garden And Id open my eyes just a sliver see the window full of moonlight And shut them again and in all of this I was happy The Fair Princess Sat in her garden Combing her hair With her golden comb    O my childhood days a doll someone broke If I could only go back in time to that house and that affection And remain there forever forever a child and forever happy But all of this is the Past a lantern on an old street corner To remember it makes me cold and hungry for something unobtainable To think of it makes me feel an absurd regret for I dont know what O slow whirlpool of conﬂicting sensations Faint vertigo of confused things in my soul Shattered furies tender feelings like spools of thread children play with Avalanches of imagination over the eyes of my senses Tears useless tears Light breezes of contradiction grazing my soul To shake off this emotion I invoke with a conscious effort I invoke with a desperate worthless arid effort The song of the Great Pirate as he was dying Fifteen men on a dead mans chest Yohoho and a bottle of rum But the song is a straight line drawn crookedly inside me With a struggle Im able but through an almost literary imagination To bring back into my souls ﬁeld of vision The rage of piracy of slaughter the almost mouthwatering appetite for pillage For the frivolous slaughter of women and children For the gratuitous torture of poorer passengers merely to amuse ourselves And the sensuality of breaking and shattering the things others most cherish But I dream all this while dreading something breathing down my neck I remember how interesting it would be To hang sons before their mothers eyes But I cant help but feel like the mothers To bury alive fouryearold children on desert isles Taking their parents there in boats to see But I shudder remembering the son I dont have whos quietly sleeping at home I try to stir a dead yearning for sea crimes For an inquisition without the excuse of Faith Crimes without even any wrath or malice behind them Carried out mechanically not to hurt not to harm And not even to amuse ourselves but just to pass the time Like country people who play solitaire at the dining table after dinner with the tablecloth pushed to one side Just for the soothing pleasure of committing heinous crimes and thinking nothing of it Of watching suffering victims reach the brink of madness and deathfrompain without letting them cross it But my imagination refuses to go along A shiver runs through me And suddenly more suddenly than before from farther away and deeper down Suddenlyoh the terror coursing through my veins Oh the sudden cold from the door to Mystery which opened in me and let in a draft I remember God the Transcendent in life and suddenly The old voice of the English sailor Jim Barnes whom I used to talk with Becomes in me the voice of my mysterious affection for silly things like a mothers lap and a sisters hair ribbon A voice arriving miraculously from beyond the appearance of things The faint and remote Voice thats now the Absolute Voice the Mouthless Voice Arriving from above and from within the seas nocturnal solitude Calling me calling me calling me It comes faintly as if mufﬂed but still audible From far away as if it sounded elsewhere and couldnt be heard here Like a stiﬂed sob a snuffed ﬂame a silent breath From no corner in space from no place in time The eternal cry of night the deep and confused murmur Ahoooooooooooo   yyy       Ahoooooooooooooooyyy          Schooner ahooooooooooooooooyy       A cold chill from the soul makes my whole body shiver And I suddenly open my eyes which I hadnt closed Ah how good to emerge once and for all from my dreams To return to the real world so easy on the nerves The world on this early morning when the days ﬁrst steamers are arriving Im no longer interested in the incoming steamer from before Its still far away Only whats close now cleanses my soul My healthy rugged pragmatic imagination Is concerned now only with useful modern things With freighters steamers and passengers With rugged immediate modern commercial real things The ﬂywheel in me is slowing down Wonderful modern maritime life Clean ﬁt and full of machines All so well ordered so spontaneously organized All the machine parts all oceangoing vessels All aspects of import and export trade activity So perfectly integrated That everything seems to happen by natural laws Nothing ever colliding with anything else Nothing has lost its poetry And now there are also machines With their poetry and this entirely new kind of life This commercial worldly intellectual and sentimental life Which the machine age has conferred on our souls Voyages are as lovely as they ever were And a ship will always be lovely just because it is a ship Travel is still travel and the faraway is where it has always been Nowhere at all thank God The ports full of every kind of steamer Large and small of various colors their portholes variously arranged And belonging to so wonderfully many shipping lines Steamers in port so individual in their separate berths So attractive in their stately calm of commercial things that ply the sea The ancient and forever Homeric sea O Ulysses The humanitarian glance of lighthouses far off in the night Or the sudden ﬂashing of a nearby lighthouse on a dark dark night How close we were to the coast And the sound of the water sings in our ear All this is as it always was but today theres commerce And the commercial destiny of the great steamers Makes me proud of my era The variety of people aboard passenger ships Fills me with the modern pride of living at a time when its so easy For races to mix together and distances to be crossed so easy to see everything And enjoy life making a good number of dreams come true Neat orderly and modern like an ofﬁce with service windows made of latticed yellow wire My present feelingsnatural and discreet like gentlemen Are practical and free of hysteria ﬁlling their lungs with ocean air Like people perfectly aware of how healthy it is to breathe air from the sea The day is now deﬁnitely geared for working Everything begins to move to get organized With great immediate and natural pleasure I follow with my soul All the commercial operations needed for a shipment of goods My era is the rubber stamp appearing on all invoices And I feel that all letters from all ofﬁces Should be addressed to me A bill of lading is so distinctive And a ship captains signature so handsome and modern The commercial formality at the beginning and end of letters Dear SirsMessieurs Amigos e Senhores Yours faithfullyNos salutations empressées All of this isnt only human and tidy but also beautiful And it ultimately has a maritime destiny a steamer on which are loaded The goods named in the letters and invoices Lifes complexity Though drawn up by people Who love hate have political passions and sometimes commit crimes The invoices are so neat so well written so independent of all that Some people look at an invoice and dont feel this Surely you felt it Cesário Verde And I feel it so humanly it makes me cry Dont try to tell me theres no poetry in business and in ofﬁces It enters through every pore I breathe it in this ocean air Because all of this concerns steamers and modern navigation Because invoices and business letters are the beginning of the story And the ships carrying the goods across the eternal sea are the end Ah and the voyagesholiday voyages and other kinds Voyages on the sea where were all companions In a special way as if a maritime mystery Brought our souls together and transformed us for a moment Into transient citizens of the same uncertain country Eternally moving over the vastness of the waters Grand hotels of the Inﬁnite O my transatlantic ships Totally and perfectly cosmopolitan for you never stay long in one place And you contain every sort of face costume and race Voyages voyagersso many different kinds So many nationalities professions and people in the world So many different directions one can take in life In this life which at heart is always always the same life So many curious faces All faces are curious And nothing makes for holiness like constantly looking at people Brotherhood is not after all a revolutionary idea Its something we learn in daily life where everything has to be tolerated And we begin to appreciate what we have to tolerate Until we nearly weep with affection for what we once tolerated Ah all this is beautiful all this is human and linked To human feelings so sociable and bourgeois So complexly simple so metaphysically sad The diversiﬁed ﬂoating life ends up educating us in humanity Poor humans Poor humans all of us I take leave of this moment in the person of this other ship Which is now setting sail Its an English tramp steamer Quite grungy as if it were a French ship With the friendly air of a seaborne proletarian And no doubt mentioned on the back page of yesterdays papers My heart goes out to the poor steamer so humble and unaffected It seems to feel responsible for something to be an honest person Faithful to some duty or other There it goes leaving its berth in front of where Im sitting on the wharf There it goes placidly passing where sailing ships once passed Long long ago To Cardiff Liverpool London It doesnt matter It does its duty As we should do ours Marvelous life Bon voyage Bon voyage Bon voyage my poor chance friend who did me the favor Of taking with you the sadness and delirium of my dreams Restoring me to life so I can watch you and see you sail aw a y Bon voyage Bon voyage Thats what life is With what natural elegance so typical of morning You sail tall and straight from out of Lisbons harbor today I feel strangely endeared and grateful to you for this For this what Who knows whatGo onSail away With a slight quiver Tchtchtchtchtchtch  The ﬂywheel in me comes to a halt Sail away slow steamer sail and dont stay Sail away from me sail out of my sight Depart from inside my heart Disappear into the Faraway the Faraway the mist of God Disappear follow your destiny and leave me Who am I to weep for you and question you Who am I to speak to you and love you Who am I to be troubled by the sight of you It pushes off from the wharf the sun rises golden shines brighter Glancing off the rooftops of the buildings on the wharf The whole of this side of the city is gleaming Depart leave me become First the ship in midriver separate and distinct Then a small black ship headed toward the bar Then a hazy point on the horizon O anxiety An ever hazier point on the horizon Then nothing just me and my sadness And the great city now bathed in sunlight And the real naked hour like a wharf without ships And the slow turning of the crane like a turning compass Tracing a semicircle of I dont know what emotion In the staggered silence of my soul
