LÀ-BAS, JE NE SAIS O Ù... The day before a journey, rrrrrring... I don’t need such a shrill reminder! I want to enjoy the repose of the station that’s my soul Before I see the iron arrival of the deﬁnitive train Approaching in my direction, Before I feel the actual departure in the throat of my stomach, Before I climb aboard, with feet That have never learned to control their emotion when it’s time to depart. Right now, as I smoke in the way station of today, I feel like still relishing a bit of the old life. A useless life that’s best left behind, that’s a prison? What of it? All the universe is a prison, and a prisoner is a prisoner whatever size his cell. My cigarette tastes like impending nausea. The train has already left the other station... Good-bye, good-bye everyone who didn’t come to see me off, Good-bye my abstract and impossible family! Good-bye to today! Good-bye, way station of today! Good-bye, life, good-bye! To remain like a labeled package someone forgot, In a corner of the waiting area on the other side of the tracks. To be found by an employee once the train has departed— “And this? Doesn’t this belong to a fellow who just left?” To remain and merely think of departing, To remain and be right, To remain and die less... I go to the future as to a difﬁcult exam. And if the train never comes and God takes pity on me? I see myself in the station that until now was just a metaphor. I’m a perfectly presentable person. You can tell—they say—that I’ve lived abroad. I have the manners of an obviously well-bred man. I grab my suitcase, rejecting the porter like a harmful vice, And both hand and suitcase tremble. To depart! I’ll never return, I’ll never return because there is no return. The place one returns to is always different, The station one returns to is never the same. The people are different, the light is different, the philosophy is different. To depart! My God, to depart! I’m afraid of departing!...
