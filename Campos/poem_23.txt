No, it’s not weariness... It’s heaps of disillusion Contaminating how I think, It’s an upside-down Sunday Of feeling, A holiday spent in the pit... No, it isn’t weariness... It’s the fact I exist And the world too, With everything in it, With everything in it that keeps unfolding And that’s just various identical copies of the same thing. No. Why call it weariness? It’s an abstract sensation Of concrete life— Sort of like a shout Not uttered, Sort of like an anxiety Not suffered, Or not suffered completely, Or not suffered like... Yes, or not suffered like... That’s it: like... Like what? If I knew, I wouldn’t have this false weariness. (Ah, blind people singing in the street... One man playing guitar, another on ﬁddle, and the woman’s voice Add up to quite a barrel organ!) Because I hear, I see. Okay, I admit it: it’s weariness!
