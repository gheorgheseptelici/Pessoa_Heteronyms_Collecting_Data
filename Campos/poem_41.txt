Yes, everything’s just ﬁne. It’s all perfectly ﬁne. Except for one thing: it’s all screwed up. I know my building is painted gray, I know what the number of the building is, I don’t know but can ﬁnd out its assessed value In the tax ofﬁces that exist for that purpose. I know, I know... But I also know there are people who live here, And the Public Revenue Ofﬁce couldn’t exempt My next-door neighbor from the death of her son. And the Bureau of What-Have-You couldn’t prevent The husband of the lady upstairs from running off with her sister. But everything, of course, is just ﬁne... And except for the fact it’s all screwed up, it really is just ﬁne.
