 To put my life in order with shelves for my will and my action Thats what I want to do as Ive always wanted with the same result But how good it is to have the clear intentionﬁrm only in its clearnessof doing something Im going to pack my suitcases for the Deﬁnitive Im going to organize Álvaro de Campos And be at the same point tomorrow as the day before yesterdaya day before yesterday thats alway s I smile in anticipation of the nothing Ill be At least I smile to smile is something Were all products of Romanticism And if we werent products of Romanticism we probably wouldnt be anything Thats how literature happens And its also sorry Gods how life happens Everyone else is also a Romantic Everyone else also achieves nothing and is either rich or poor Everyone else also spends life looking at suitcases that still need to be packed Everyone else also falls asleep next to a clutter of papers Everyone else is also me Peddler crying out her wares like an unconscious hymn Tiny cogwheel in the clockwork of political economy Present or future mother of those who die when Empires crumble Your voice reaches me like a summons to nowhere like the silence of life I look up from the papers Im thinking of not putting in order after all To the window through which I didnt seeI just heardthe peddler And my smile which still hadnt ended ends in metaphysics inside my brain I disbelieved in all the gods while sitting at a cluttered desk I looked all destinies in the face because I was distracted by a shouting peddler My weariness is an old boat rotting on a deserted beach And with this image from some other poet I close my desk and the poem Like a god Ive put neither truth nor life in order
