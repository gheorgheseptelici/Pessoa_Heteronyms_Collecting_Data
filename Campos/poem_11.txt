CHANCE In the street where all is chance the blonde girl chances by. But no, it’s a different one. The other girl was on another street, in another city, and I was another. I suddenly stray from the sight in front of me, I’m back in the other city, on the other street, And the other girl walks by. What an advantage to have an intransigent memory! Now I regret never again having seen the other girl, And I regret not even having looked at this one. What an advantage to have a soul that’s inside out! At least some verses get written. Verses get written, one passes for a madman, and then a genius If luck will have it, or even if it won’t— The marvel of celebrity! I was saying that at least some verses get written... This was with respect to a girl, A blonde girl, But which one? There was one I saw a long time ago in another city, On another sort of street, And there’s this one I saw a long time ago in another city, On another sort of street. Since all memories are the same memory, Everything that was is the same death, Yesterday, today, and maybe even tomorrow. A passerby looks at me with casual curiosity. Could it be that I’m making verses in gestures and frowns? Perhaps...The blonde g irl? It’s the same girl after all... Everything’s the same after all... Only I am in some sense not the same, and this is also the same.
