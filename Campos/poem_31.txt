My heart, the deluded admiral Who ruled a ﬂeet of never-built ships, Followed a route Fate wouldn’t admit, In search of an impossible happiness. Absurd, verbose, always on the shelf, Given to a life that merely abstains, He never gave himself, never gave himself, never gave himself, As the run-on verse explains. But there are advantages to a history Lived in the shadows; the silence of defeat Has inner roses unknown to victory. And so the admiral’s imperial ﬂeet, Laden with yearnings and dreams of glory, Followed its course with no retreat. [?]
