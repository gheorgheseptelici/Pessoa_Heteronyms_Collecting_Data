MAGNIFICAT When will this inner night—the universe— end And I—my soul—have my day? When will I wake up from being awake? I don’t know. The sun shines on high And cannot be looked at. The stars coldly blink And cannot be counted. The heart beats alooﬂy And cannot be heard. When will this drama without theater —Or this theater without drama— end So that I can go home? Where? How? When? O cat staring at me with eyes of life, Who lurks in your depths? It’s Him! It’s him! Like Joshua he’ll order the sun to stop, and I’ll wake up, And it will be day. Smile, my soul, in your slumber! Smile, my soul: it will be day!
