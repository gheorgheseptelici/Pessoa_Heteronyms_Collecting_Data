ENGLISH SONG I broke with the sun and stars. I let the world go. I went far and deep with the knapsack of things I know. I made the journey, bought the useless, found the indeﬁnite, And my heart is the same as it was: a sky and a desert. I failed in what I was, in what I wanted, in what I discovered. I’ve no soul left for light to arouse or darkness to smother. I’m nothing but nausea, nothing but reverie, nothing but longing. I’m something very far removed, and I keep going Just because my I feels cozy and profoundly real, Stuck like a wad of spit to one of the world’s wheels.
