AH, A SONNET... My heart is a mad admiral Who quit his life at sea And remembers it little by little At home, pacing, pacing... With this motion (the mere thought Of which makes me shift in my seat) The seas he once sailed still toss In his muscles bored of inactivity. Nostalgia’s in his legs and arms. Nostalgia pours out of his brain. His boredom turns into raving. But if, for God’s sake, the heart Was my theme, why is this poem dealing With an admiral instead of with feeling?
