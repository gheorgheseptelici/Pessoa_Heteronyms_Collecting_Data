I have a bad cold And everyone knows how bad colds Throw the whole universe out of kilter They turn us against life And make us sneeze even metaphysically Ive wasted the whole day blowing my nose My head hurts all over A sorry state for a minor poet Today Im truly a minor poet What I used to be was a wish it snapped Goodbye forever Fairy Queen You had wings of sunlight and here I am plodding along I wont get well unless I lie down in bed Ive never been well except when lying down in the universe Excusez du peu    What a terrible physical cold I need truth and some aspirin
