ALMOST To put my life in order, with shelves for my will and my action... That’s what I want to do, as I’ve always wanted, with the same result. But how good it is to have the clear intention—ﬁrm only in its clearness—of doing something! I’m going to pack my suitcases for the Deﬁnitive, I’m going to organize Álvaro de Campos, And be at the same point tomorrow as the day before yesterday—a day before yesterday that’s alway s... I smile in anticipation of the nothing I’ll be. At least I smile: to smile is something. We’re all products of Romanticism, And if we weren’t products of Romanticism, we probably wouldn’t be anything. That’s how literature happens... And it’s also (sorry, Gods!) how life happens. Everyone else is also a Romantic, Everyone else also achieves nothing and is either rich or poor, Everyone else also spends life looking at suitcases that still need to be packed, Everyone else also falls asleep next to a clutter of papers, Everyone else is also me. Peddler crying out her wares like an unconscious hymn, Tiny cogwheel in the clockwork of political economy, Present or future mother of those who die when Empires crumble, Your voice reaches me like a summons to nowhere, like the silence of life... I look up from the papers I’m thinking of not putting in order after all To the window through which I didn’t see—I just heard—the peddler, And my smile, which still hadn’t ended, ends in metaphysics inside my brain. I disbelieved in all the gods while sitting at a cluttered desk, I looked all destinies in the face because I was distracted by a shouting peddler, My weariness is an old boat rotting on a deserted beach, And with this image from some other poet I close my desk and the poem. Like a god, I’ve put neither truth nor life in order.
