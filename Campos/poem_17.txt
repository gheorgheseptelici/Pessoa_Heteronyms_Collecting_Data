What happiness In the building across the street from me and my dreams! It’s inhabited by people I don’t know, whom I’ve seen but not seen. They’re happy, because they’re not me. The children who play on the high balconies Live forever, without doubt, Among ﬂowerpots. The voices rising from inside the homes Always sing, without doubt. Yes, they must sing. When there’s feasting out here, there’s feasting in there, Which is bound to be the case where everything’s in agreement: Man with Nature, because the city is Nature. What tremendous happiness not to be me! But don’t others feel the same way? What others? There are no others. What others feel is a home with shut windows, And when they’re opened It’s for their children to play on the railed balcony, Among the pots with I don’t know what sort of ﬂowers. Other people never feel. We’re the ones who feel, Yes, all of us, Even I, who am now feeling nothing. Nothing? Well... A slight pain that’s nothing...
