 My soul shattered like an empty vase It fell irretrievably down the stairs If fell from the hands of the careless maid It fell breaking into more pieces than there was china in the vase Nonsense Impossible Im not so sure I have more sensations than when I felt like myself Im a scattering of shards on a doormat that needs shaking My fall made a noise like a shattering vase All the gods there are lean over the stair rail And look at the shards their maid changed me into They dont get mad at her Theyre forgiving What was I but an empty vase They look at the absurdly conscious shards Conscious of themselves not of the gods They look and smile They smile forgivingly at the unwitting maid The great staircase stretches out carpeted with stars A shard gleams shiny side up among the heavenly bodies My work My primary soul My life A shard And the gods stare at it intrigued not knowing why its there
