I wake up in the middle of the night and its silence. I see—ticktock—that it’s four hours until morning. In the despair of my insomnia I throw open the window. And across the way I see the human, Crisscrossed rectangle of another lit window! Fraternity in the night! Involuntary, secret fraternity in the night! We’re both awake, and humanity doesn’t know. It sleeps. We have light. Who are you? A sick man, a counterfeiter, or just an insomniac like me? It doesn’t matter. The eternal, formless, inﬁnite night Has only, in this place, the humanity of our two windows, The quiet heart of our two lights. In this place and time, strangers to each other, we’re all of life. At the window in the back room of my apartment, Feeling the damp of night on the wooden sill, I lean out toward the inﬁnite, and a bit toward myself. Not even a rooster disturbs the still deﬁnitive silence! What are you doing, comrade of that lit window? Am I, in my insomnia, dreaming life? Round yellow glow of your secret window... Funny: you don’t have electric light. O kerosene lamps of my lost childhood!
