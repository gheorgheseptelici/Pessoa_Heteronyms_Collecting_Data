 TO   Portugal InﬁnityJune eleventh nineteen hundred and ﬁfteen Heylaaaaaaa From here in Portugal with every historical age in my brain I salute you Walt I salute you my Universal brother Forever modern and eternal the singer of concrete absolutes Passionate mistress of the scattered universe Great homosexual who rubs against the diversity of things Sexualized by stones by trees by people by professions Full of lust for passing bodies chance encounters mere observations Champion of the material substance of all things My glorious hero who goes into Death skipping Greeting God with shouts and roars and squeals Singer of ﬁerce and tender brotherhood with all things Great democrat in all your pores close in body and soul to everything Carnival of all actions bacchanalia of all intentions Twin brother of all initiatives JeanJacques Rousseau of the world bound to produce machines Homer of the elusive carnal ﬂux Shakespeare of sensations that were beginning to run on steam MiltonShelley of Electricity on the horizon Incubus of all gestures Inner spasm of all outer objects Pimp of the whole Universe Slut of all solar systems pansy of God I with my monocle and exaggeratedly tightwaisted coat Am not unworthy of you Walt and you know it Im not unworthy of you for the simple reason that I salute you I so prone to inertia and so easily bored Am one of yours you know I am and I love and understand you And although I never met you being born around the year you died I know you loved me too you knew me and it gladdens my heart I know that you knew me considered me and explained me And I know that thats what I am whether on the Brooklyn Ferry ten years before I was born Or on the Rua do Ouro today thinking about everything thats not the Rua do Ouro And as you felt everything I feel everything we walk hand in hand Hand in hand Walt hand in hand dancing the universe in our soul I kiss your picture all the time Wherever you are now I dont know where but I know its God You feel this I know you feel it and my kisses in person are warmer Which is how you want them and so you thank me from where you are Im sure of it something tells me soa satisﬁed feeling in my spirit An indirect abstract erection in the depths of my soul You were cyclopean and muscular not pretty Yet your attitude toward the world was feminine And for you each leaf of grass each stone and each man was the Universe Heres to you dear old Walt my great Comrade evoe I belong to your Bacchic orgy of unbridled sensations Im one of yoursfrom the feeling in my feet to the nausea in my dreams Im one of yours look at me From where you are in God you see me in reverse From inside outYou d ivine my body what you see is my soul Seeing it directly and through its eyes my body Look at me you know that I Álvaro de Campos engineer Sensationist poet Am not your disciple not your lover and not your singer You know Im You and are glad for it I can never read much of your poetry at once Its too full of feeling I move through your verses as through a jostling crowd And they smell to me of sweat of various oils of human and mechanical activity So that I ﬁnally dont know if Im reading or living I dont know if my true place is in the world or in your poetry I dont know if Im here with both feet on the natural earth Or if Im hanging upside down in some sort of emporium Dangling from the natural ceiling of your tumultuous inspiration From the middle of the ceiling of your unattainable intensity Open all the doors Im coming through My password Walt Whitman But to hell with a password Ill just come on through Ill break down the doors if I have to Yes I who am meek and civilized will break down the doors Because in this moment Im not meek or civilized Im ME a thinking universe of ﬂesh and blood that wants to get through And that will get through for when I want to get through Im God Get this rubbish out of my sight Stash these emotions into drawers Away with politicians literati Smug businessmen policemen prostitutes pimps All of this is the letter that kills not the spirit that gives life The spirit that gives life in this moment is ME Let no son of a bitch cross my path My path is through inﬁnity all the way to the end Whether or not I can reach the end is none of your business let me go It concerns only me and God and the meaningthatsme of the word Inﬁnite For ward  I dig in the spurs And I feel the spurs Im the selfsame horse I ride Because I through my will to be one with God Can be everything or nothing or anything Depending on my moodIts no one elses business Raging delirium I want to yelp to leap To rant rave jump twirl and shout with my body To cling to car wheels and get rolled over To lie beneath the twisting of the whip thats going to crack      To be the shedog of all hedogs and still not be satisﬁed To be the ﬂywheel of all machines and never go fast enough To be whatevers crushed abandoned uprooted destroyed And all for you to sing and salute you      Dance with me this delirium Walt in the world where you are now Hop with me in this tribal dance that bumps into the stars Fall with me to the ground from exhaustion Dash with me into the walls until were dazed Shatter with me into smithereens      In all through all around all without all An abstract bodily rage stirring maelstroms in the soul Come on Forward Even if God tries to stop us lets go forwardIt d oesnt matter Lets go forward Forward to no place at all Inﬁnity The Universe Goal with no goal What does it matter Boom boom boom boom boom Right now yes lets go straight ahead boom Boom Boom Huphup    huphup    huphup    huphup Like a hurled thunderbolt I rush Toward you in leaps of the heart With military bands leading the way I keep saluting you In a grand procession with frenzied shouting and jumping I scream out your name at the top of my lungs And every cheer for me and for you and for God I give to you And the universe spins around us like a carousel with music inside our heads And I with intrinsic lights in my anterior epidermis Mad from the drunken musical hissing of machines And you the renowned the reckless you    And so its to you I address My verses that are leaps my verses that are jumps my spasm verses My hystericalattack verses My verses that pull the carriage of my nerves Tripping and stumbling I get inspired Im so excited I can hardly breathe or stand still And my verses are my not being able to burst from living Throw open all the windows Rip all the doors off their hinges Pull the house down on top of me I want to live at large in the open air I want to have gestures outside my body I want to run like rain down the walls I want to be stepped on like the paving stones of roadways I want to sink like a dead weight to the bottom of the sea With a sensuality I lost ages ago I dont want latches on the doors I dont want locks on coffers I want to mix in to merge to be swept along I want to become someone elses aching possession To be dumped out of garbage cans To be tossed into the sea To be sought out at home for obscene purposes Anything but to keep on sitting here quietly Anything but to keep on writing these verses I want a world without gaps I want objects to materially touch each other and interpenetrate I want physical bodies to belong to each other like souls Not just dynamically but statically too I want to ﬂy and to fall from high up To be hurled like a grenade To end up in X to be taken to Y Abstract apogee at the end of me and of everything Motorized iron climax Stairless staircase of speed climbing higher Hydraulic pump extracting my throbbing guts like an anchor Put me in shackles just so that I can break them So that I can break them with my teeth and make my teeth bleed O masochistic bloodspurting joy of life The sailors took me prisoner Their hands squeezed me in the darkness And I died for a moment when I felt this Then my soul licked the ﬂoor of my private jail To the shrill buzzing of impossibilities surrounding my ire Leap jump bite down on the bit Redhot Pegasus of my restless yearnings Uncertain end of my motorized destiny Jump leap drape yourself with ﬂags Mark the nocturnal vastness with your trail in blood In hot blood stretching far behind you In fresh blood stretching far behind you In cold living blood through the air I dynamically feel Jump hurdle leap Alleyoop keep jumping       My cavalcadeprayer My forward chargesalutation Who besides you felt the individual life in each thing Who besides you felt himself and life and us to exhaustion Who besides you always preferred the spare part to the regular one And made it his norm to violate Lifes norms and forms      My happiness is a rage My forward charge a collision Bam In me In you O Master of my healthful disease I salute the ﬁrst classic case of universalitis The Whitman syndrome which is what afﬂicts me St Walt of Shrieking Deliriums and Rage  Gateway to everything Bridge to everything Road to everything Your omnivorous soul      Your soul thats bird ﬁsh beast man woman Your soul the two where there are two Your soul the one thats two where two are one Your soul thats arrow lightning

Postmark on all letters Name in all addresses Merchandise delivered returned in transit Train of sensations moving at soulmiles per hour Per hour per minute per second  And all these natural human and machine noises Go together a sum tumult of everything Full of me to you saluting you Human shouts and earthly cries Echoes from hills The burbling of waters The loud blasts of war The weeping clamor of suffering peoples The mufﬂed sounds of sighs in the darkness And closer to life surrounding me And its my ﬁnest prize for saluting you There are the whistles chugging and screeching of trains The modern noises factory noises Steady hum Motor wheels Flywheels Propellers Boom  In a great allcitiesofEurope marche aux ﬂambeaux  In a great war march of industry commerce and leisure In a great race

Heyla   Heyla Im going to summon All the human swarming of the Universe All varieties of all emotions All types of all thoughts All wheels all gears and all pistons of the soul To the blaring deafening privilege of saluting you Huphup I shout And in a procession of Me to you they all rumble In a metaphysical and real gibberish In an uproar of things clashing within me      Ave hail hurrah O great bastard of Apollo Passionate impotent lover of the nine Muses and three Graces Funicular from Olympus to us and from us to Olympus Rage of the modern materialized in me Transparent spasm of being Flower of other peoples actions Joyous feasting because theres Life Mad fury because no one has enough life to be all men Since being means being a bastard and only God could satisfy us Ah you sang everything and yet left everything unsung Who in his body can throb harder than his body throbs Who can feel more feelings than there are to feel Who can be sufﬁcient when nothing sufﬁces Who can be complete as long as one blade of grass Has its root outside his heart  Open all the doors Break all the windows Remove the locks from this enclosing life Remove this enclosing life from this enclosing life Let closing be openness with no locks as reminders Let stopping be the ignorant term for continuing Let the end be an always abstract thing Fluidly connected to every end ever reached I want to breathe Strip my body of all its weight Replace my soul with abstract wings attached to nothing No not wings just the enormous Wing of Flight itself No not even Flight just the speed that remains when ceasing becomes ﬂying And theres no body to weigh down the soul of Going I want to be the heat of living things the fever Of saps the rhythm of waves and the      Gap in Being that allows Being to be No boundaries anywhere No divisions in anything Just Me  Where Im not the ﬁrst I prefer to be nothing to not be there Where I cant be the ﬁrst to act I prefer to watch others act Where I cant rule I refuse even to obey I ardently yearn for everything so ardently that I never miss ou t  And I dont miss out because I dont try All or nothing has a special relevance for me But I cant be universal because Im individual I cant be all men because Im One just one just me I cant be ﬁrst in anything because there is no ﬁrst And so I prefer the nothing of being nothing but that nothing When does the last train leave Walt I want to leave this city known as Earth I want to emigrate from the country of Me once and for all To leave the world like a man who realizes hes bankrupt Like a traveling salesman who sells ships to people from the interior To the junk heap with broken motors What was my entire being An enormous useless yearning A sterile pursuit of an impossible goal A madmans machine to achieve perpetual motion An absurd theorem to prove that a circle is square An attempt to swim across the Atlantic that failed Before I ever entered the water just by looking at it and calculating A hail of stones at the moon An absurd desire for the two parallels of God and life to meet My nerves megalomania My rigid bodys yearning for elasticity My physical self s rage because its not the sovereign axis The sensual vehicle of abstract enthusiasm The worlds dynamic void Lets leave Being behind us Lets leave for good this small town called Life This suburbWorld of God And lets venture into the city headlong Without stopping just madly Going Lets go away once and for all When does the last train leave for where you are Walt What God was I that my nostalgia should arouse such yearnings Perhaps by departing Ill return Perhaps by ending Ill arrive Who knows Any time is the right time Lets leave Come on The road is waiting for us To leave is to have already gone Lets leave for where everything stays put O road to nomoreroads The last stop of NoStopping  In my poems I sing of trains I sing of cars I sing of steamers But however high I hoist my poem it has only rhythms and ideas It has no steel iron or wheels it has no wood no ropes It lacks the reality of a roads most negligible stone The stone people step on without ever looking at it But which may be looked at picked up stepped on Whereas my poems are like ideas that may or may not be understood What I want is iron not just to sing of iron What I think gives only the idea of steel not the steel What infuriates me in all my minds emotions Is that I cant swap my rhythm that mimics rippling water For the real coolness of water on my hands For the visible sound of the river where I can enter and get wet Which can make my suit drip Where I can drown myself if I like And which has the natural divinity of being there without literature Shit A thousand times shit for everything I cant do But what Walt can you hear me is everything everything everything Damn the bad luck of our not being God Such that our ﬂesh could write poems in Universes and Realities And our ideas be things our thoughts Inﬁnity And Id have real stars in my thinkingbeing Numbernames in every corner of my emotionEarth  The true modern poem is life without poems Its the train itself and not verses that sing of it Its the iron of the rails the hot rails the iron of the wheels their actual spin And not my poems that talk about rails and wheels they dont have  The windup or stringpulled train of a child Has more real motion than our poems Our poems that dont have wheels Our poems that go nowhere Our unread poems that never leave the page Im sick of life sick of art Sick of not having things either out of lack or out of fear My breathing like a practical joke to torment me My selfimage like a ridiculous carnival puppet When does the last train leave I know that the way I sing of you isnt by singing of you but so what I know its by singing of everything but to sing of everything is to sing of you I know its by singing of me but to sing of me is to sing of you I know that even to say I cant sing is to sing of you Walt  To sing of you To salute you Id have to write the supreme poem Which more than any other supreme poem would embrace In a total synthesis based on an exhaustive analysis The whole Universe of things living beings and souls The whole Universe of men women and children The whole Universe of acts gestures feelings thoughts The whole Universe of the things mankind makes And the things mankind experiences Professions laws norms medical sciences Fate Written this way and that constantly crisscrossing On the dynamic paper of Events On the quick papyrus of social groupings On the palimpsest of continuously renewed emotions  For me to salute you To salute you as you should be saluted I need to make my verses into a steed Make my verses into a train Make my verses into an arrow Make my verses sheer speed Make my verses the things of the world You sang everything and in you everything sang Magniﬁcent whorish receptivity Of your sensations with their legs wide open To the outlines and details of the whole universe  Huphup what or why or to where Huphup to what end Huphup to where makebelieve steed Huphup to where imaginary train Huphup to where O arrow haste and speed Which are all just me pining after you All just me feeling your absence in every last nerve Huphup to where if there is no where or how Huphup to where if Im always where I am and never up ahead Never ahead and never behind But always irremediably in the place of my body All too humanly in the thinking center of my soul Always the same indivisible atom of the divine personality Huphup to where O sadness of not achieving what I want Huphup to where and for what Huphup what or without what Huphuphup but where to O my uncertainty If only I could stop writing verse on verse on verse about iron And see have and be iron instead and have that be my poetry Poetryironpoetry psychophysioI circle When does the last train leave  Time for our vitality to declare bankruptcy We write poetry singing of the things we dont live our bankruptcies If only there were a way to live all lives and all ages And all forms of form And all gestures of gestures Whats the writing of poetry but a confession that life isnt enough Whats art but a way to forget that life is just this Farewell Walt farewell Farewell until the indeﬁnite that lies beyond the End Wait for me if where you are you can wait When does the last train leave When do we leave  Huphup Hup what and hup why What do I get from huphup or from anything Prompting me to think of huphup Decadents old boy thats what we are Deep down in each of us theres a Byzantium in ﬂames And although I dont feel the ﬂames and dont feel Byzantium The Empire is dying out in our watery veins And Poetry was but our incapacity to act You singer of vigorous professions You the Poet of the Strong and the Extreme You inspirations muscle ruled by male muses You ﬁnally an innocent in a state of hysteria Finally just a caresser of life A shiftless idler a pansy at least in spirit That was your business nobody elses but wheres Life in all that I an engineer by profession sick of everything and everyone I absolutely superﬂuous at war with things I useless wornout unproductive pretentious and amoral Buoy of my sensations scattered by the storm Anchor in the depths that broke off from my ship Ican you believe ita singer of Life and Power I healthy and vigorous like you in my poems And even sincere like you burning with all Europe in my brain In my explosive brain with no dikes to contain it In my dynamic master intelligence In my trademark projector bankcheck rubberstamp sensuality Why the devil do we live and write verses Damn the sloth that makes us poets The degeneracy that fools us into thinking were artists The fundamental tedium that tries to pass us off as energetic and modern When all we really want is to amuse ourselves to savor an idea of life Since we do nothing and are nothing life limply ﬂowing through our veins Lets at least see things as they really are Walt Lets swallow all this like a bitter pill And agree to send life and the world to hell Because were tired of looking at it not because we abhor or disdain it Is this any way to salute you Whatever it is its to salute you Whatever its worth its to love you Whatever it comes to its to agree with you Whatever it is its this And you understand you like it You old boy crying on my shoulder agree with me When does the last train leave A long holiday spent in God Lets go without fear lets go  All this must have another meaning Beyond just living and having all we have There must be a point of consciousness In which the landscape is transformed And begins to interest us assist us arouse us In which a cool breeze stirs in our soul And sunny ﬁelds open up in our recently awakened senses Well meet at the Station wherever it is Wait for me at the entrance Walt Ill be there Ill be there without the universe without life without myself without anything And well remember all by ourselves in silence and with our sorrow The worlds tremendous absurdity the bitter inadequacy of things And Ill feel the great mystery Ill feel it far away so far aw a y So abstractly and absolutely far away Deﬁnitively far away  I stop I listen I recognize myself The sound of my voice in the air has fallen lifeless Im the same as I was you are dead and everything is still Saluting you was a way of trying to inject life into myself And so I saluted you in spite of feeling that I lack The vital energy to salute anyone O heart that wont heal Who will save me from you
