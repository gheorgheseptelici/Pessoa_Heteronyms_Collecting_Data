I’m dizzy. Dizzy from too much sleeping or too much thinking Or too much of both. All I know is I’m dizzy, And I’m not sure if I should get up from my chair Or how I would get up from it. I’m dizzy—let’s leave it at that. What life Did I make out of life? None. It all happened in the cracks, It was all approximations, All a function of the abnormal and the absurd, All essentially nothing... That’s why I’m dizzy. Now Every morning I wake up Dizzy... Yes, literally dizzy... Unsure of my own name, Unsure of where I am, Unsure of what I’ve been, Unsure of everything. But if that’s how it is, that’s how it is. So I remain in the chair. I’m dizzy. That’s right, I’m dizzy. I remain seated And dizzy. Yes, dizzy. Dizzy... Dizzy...
