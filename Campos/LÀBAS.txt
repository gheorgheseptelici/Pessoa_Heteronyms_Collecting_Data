 JE NE  O Ù The day before a journey rrrrrring I dont need such a shrill reminder I want to enjoy the repose of the station thats my soul Before I see the iron arrival of the deﬁnitive train Approaching in my direction Before I feel the actual departure in the throat of my stomach Before I climb aboard with feet That have never learned to control their emotion when its time to depart Right now as I smoke in the way station of today I feel like still relishing a bit of the old life A useless life thats best left behind thats a prison What of it All the universe is a prison and a prisoner is a prisoner whatever size his cell My cigarette tastes like impending nausea The train has already left the other station Goodbye goodbye everyone who didnt come to see me off Goodbye my abstract and impossible family Goodbye to today Goodbye way station of today Goodbye life goodbye To remain like a labeled package someone forgot In a corner of the waiting area on the other side of the tracks To be found by an employee once the train has departed And this Doesnt this belong to a fellow who just left To remain and merely think of departing To remain and be right To remain and die less I go to the future as to a difﬁcult exam And if the train never comes and God takes pity on me I see myself in the station that until now was just a metaphor Im a perfectly presentable person You can tellthey saythat Ive lived abroad I have the manners of an obviously wellbred man I grab my suitcase rejecting the porter like a harmful vice And both hand and suitcase tremble To depart Ill never return Ill never return because there is no return The place one returns to is always different The station one returns to is never the same The people are different the light is different the philosophy is different To depart My God to depart Im afraid of departing
