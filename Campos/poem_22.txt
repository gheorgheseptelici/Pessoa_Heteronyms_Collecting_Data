HOLIDAY RETREAT The stillness of night in this mountain retreat... The stillness that intensiﬁes The watchdogs’ scattered barking in the night... The silence, accentuated By a slight buzzing or rustling of something in the darkness... Ah, how oppressive all this is! As oppressive as being happy! What an idyllic life this would be for somebody else, With this monotonous buzz or rustle of nothing Beneath the star-studded sky, With the barking of dogs punctuating the vast stillness! I came to rest up, But I forgot to leave myself at home. I brought along the deep-seated thorn of consciousness, The vague nausea, the ill-deﬁned afﬂiction of self-awareness. Always this anxiety chewed bit by bit, Like dry dark bread that crumbles and falls. Always this uneasiness swallowed in bitter sips, Like the wine of a drunkard not even nausea can deter. Always, always, always This poor circulation in my soul, This blacking out of my sensations, This... Your slender hands, somewhat pale and somewhat my own, Lay perfectly still in your lap that day, As the scissors and thimble of another girl might lie. You sat there lost in thought, looking at me as into space. (I remember this so as to have something to think about without thinking.) Suddenly, half sighing, you interrupted what you were being. You consciously looked at me and said: “It’s a pity every day can’t be like this.” Like that day that wasn’t anything... Ah, you didn’t know, Fortunately you didn’t know, That the pity is that all days are like this, like this... The pity is that, happily or unhappily, The soul must enjoy or suffer the profound tedium of everything, Consciously or unconsciously, Thinking or not yet thinking... That is the pity... I photographically remember your listless hands Lying there, still. I remember them, in this moment, more than I remember you. What’s become of you? I know that, in the enormous elsewhere of life, You married. I presume you’re a mother. You’re probably happy. Why wouldn’t you be? Only because of some injustice. Yes, it would be unfair... Unfair? (It was a sunny day in the ﬁelds and I dozed, smiling.) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Life... White wine or red, it’s all the same: it’s to throw up.
