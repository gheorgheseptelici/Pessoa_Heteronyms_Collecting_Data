I got off the train And said goodbye to the man Id met Wed been together for eighteen hours And had a pleasant conversation Fellowship in the journey And I was sorry to get off sorry to leave This chance friend whose name I never learned I felt my eyes water with tears Every farewell is a death Yes every farewell is a death In the train that we call life We are all chance events in one anothers lives And we all feel sorry when its time to get off All that is human moves me because Im a man All that is human moves me not because I have an afﬁnity With human ideas or human doctrines But because of my inﬁnite fellowship with humanity itself The maid who hated to go Crying with nostalgia For the house where shed been mistreated All of this inside my heart is death and the worlds sadness All of this lives because it dies inside my heart And my heart is a little larger than the entire universe
