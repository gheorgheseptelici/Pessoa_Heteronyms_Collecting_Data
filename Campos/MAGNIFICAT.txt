 When will this inner nightthe universe end And Imy soulhave my day When will I wake up from being awake I dont know The sun shines on high And cannot be looked at The stars coldly blink And cannot be counted The heart beats alooï¬‚y And cannot be heard When will this drama without theater Or this theater without drama end So that I can go home Where How When O cat staring at me with eyes of life Who lurks in your depths Its Him Its him Like Joshua hell order the sun to stop and Ill wake up And it will be day Smile my soul in your slumber Smile my soul it will be day
