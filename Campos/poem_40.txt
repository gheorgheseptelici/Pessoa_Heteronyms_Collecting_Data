HOMECOMING It’s been years since my last sonnet, But I’ll try to write one anyhow. Sonnets belong to childhood, and now My childhood is just a black dot, Which throws me off the useless, unmoving Journey of the train that’s me. And the sonnet’s like someone inhabiting (For two days now) my mind’s constant musing. Thank God I still remember that It takes fourteen lines of equal length, So people will know where they’re at... But where people are, or where I am, I don’t know and couldn’t care less, And whatever I do know can be damned.
