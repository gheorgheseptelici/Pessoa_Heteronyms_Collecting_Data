 Its before I take opium that my soul is sick To feel life is to wilt like a convalescent And so I seek in opiums consolation An East to the east of the East This life on board is sure to kill me Fever rages in my head day and night And although I search until Im ill I cant ﬁnd the spring to set me right In paradox and astral incompetence In golden folds I live my days A wave in which dignitys a descent And pleasures are ganglia of my malaise Its through a clockwork of disasters A mechanism of pseudoﬂywheels That I walk among visions of gallows In a garden of stemless ﬂoating ﬂowers I stagger through the handiwork Of an inner life of lace and lacquer Its as though at home I had the knife That beheaded St John the Baptist Im atoning for a crime in a suitcase That my grandfather committed for fun My nerves hang from the gibbet by the dozen And Ive fallen into the pit of opium With the soporiﬁc nudge of morphine I lose myself in throbbing transparencies And on a diamondstudded night the moon Rises as if it were my Destiny Always a bad student now I simply watch the ship plow on Through the Suez Canal carrying along My life mere camphor in the dawn Gone are the days I put to good use All I earned from my work was fatigue Which feels today like an arm round my neck That chokes me and keeps me from falling I was a child like everyone else Born in a small town Portuguese And Ive met people from England Who say I speak English with ease Id like to have poems and stories Published by Plon and Mércure But I doubt this lifea voyage Without stormscan long endure Though it has its amusing moments Life on board is a sad affair I talk with Germans Swedes and Brits But the pain of living is always there To sail East to see China and India Wasnt worth it after all Theres only one way of living And the earths the same and small Thats why I take opium As a medicine Im convalescing from the Moment I live on thoughts ground ﬂoor And to see Life go by is a torment I smoke I yawn Were there only an earth Where far to the east didnt become west Why did I visit the India that exists If theres no India but the soul I possess Disgrace was my only legacy The gypsies stole my Fortune Perhaps not even near death will I see A shelter to keep me warm I pretended to study engineering Lived in Scotland Saw Ireland on holiday Outside the doors of Happiness my heart Begs for alms like a little old lady Dont call iron ship at Port Said Turn right I dont even know where to I pass the days with the count in the smoking room A swindling French count who lingers at funerals I glumly return to Europe destined To become a sleepwalking poet Im a monarchist but not a Catholic And Id like to be someone of note Id like to have money and beliefs To be various dull people Ive seen As things stand now Im nothing But a passenger on a ship at sea I dont have any personality Even the cabin boy makes a more lasting Impression with his lofty bearing Of a Scottish laird whos been fasting I dont belong anywhere My country Is wherever Im not Im sick and weak The steward is a rogue He saw me With the Swedish lady and w inked One day Ill cause a scandal on board Just to make the others tattle Im fed up with life and think its natural That sometimes I ﬂy off the handle I spend all day smoking and drinking American drugs that numb every pain I who am already naturally drunk My roselike nerves need a better brain I can hardly even feel the talent I have for writing these lines Life is a big house in the country That would bore any sensitive mind The English were made for existence No people has a closer alliance With Tranquility Put in a coin And out comes an Englishman all smiles I belong to that class of Portuguese Who once India was discovered were out Of work Death is a sure thing This is something I often think about To hell with life and having to live it I dont even read the book by my bed Im sick of the East Its a painted mat Whose beauty once rolled up is dead So I fall into opium Its too much To expect me to live one of those ideal Lives Honest people with set times For going to bed and taking their meals Can go to the devil Yes this is envy These keyedup nerves are my demise If only some ship could take me to where Id want only what I see with my eyes Who am I fooling Id still get bored Id want a yet stronger opium by which To reach dreams that would ﬁnish me off And pitch me into a muddy ditch Fever If what I have isnt fever Then I dont know what fevers like The essential fact is that Im sick This hare friends has outrun its luck Night has fallen Theres the ﬁrst blast Announcing dinner time to get spruce Social life above all else Well promenade Like dogs until we work our collars loose This story is bound to have a less Than happy close with blood and a gun Hooray at the end of my restlessness For which nothing can be done Whoever sees me must ﬁnd me banal Me and my life A yo ung chap right Even my monocle makes me belong To a universal stereotype How many people like me toe the Line And like me are mystics How many under their de rigueur jackets Feel like me the horror of existence If at least I could be as interesting On the outside as I am inwardly Im spiraling toward the Maelstroms center My doing nothing is what condemned me A donothing yes but with good reason Could I but hold everyone in disdain And be even if dressed in a shabby suit A hero handsome damned or insane I feel like sticking my hands in my mouth And biting until I shake with pain It would be an original activity And amuse the others the socalled sane Absurdity like a ﬂower from the India I never found in India sprouts In my sick and tired brain  God Change my life or else snuff it out Let me stay here in this chair Until they pack me into a casket I was born to be a mandarin But lack the serenity tea and mat Ah how Id love to fall right from here Through a trapdoorclackto my grave Life tastes to me like mild tobacco All I ever did was smoke life away What I really want is faith and peace And to get these sensations under control Put an end to this God Open the ﬂoodgates Enough of this comedy in my soul   Aboard ship in the Suez Canal
