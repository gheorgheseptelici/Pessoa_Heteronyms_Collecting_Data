POEM IN A STRAIGHT LINE I’ve never known anyone who took a beating. All my acquaintances have been champions at everything. Whereas I, so often shabby, so often disgusting, so often despicable, I, so often and undeniably a sponger, Inexcusably ﬁlthy, I, who so often have been too lazy to take a bath, I, who so often have been ridiculous and absurd, Who have tripped in public on the rugs of etiquette, Who have been grotesque, petty, obsequious and arrogant, Who have been humiliated and said nothing, Who, when I’ve spoken up, have been even more ridiculous, I, who have been the laughingstock of chambermaids, Who have felt porters winking behind my back, Who have been a ﬁnancial disgrace, borrowing money I never paid back, Who, when punches were about to ﬂy, ducked Out of punching range— I, who have anguished over the pettiest things, Am convinced there’s no one in the world as pathetic as me. No one I know has ever done anything ridiculous. No one who talks to me has ever been humiliated. They’ve been princes in life, every last one of them... If only I could hear some other human voice Confess not to a sin but to an infamy, Tell not about an act of violence but of cowardice! No, all the people I listen to, if they talk to me, are paragons. Who in this wide world would admit to me that he was ever despicable? O princes, my brothers, I’ve had it up to here with demigods! Where in the world are there people? Am I the only one on earth who’s ever wrong and despicable? They may not have been loved by women, They may have been cheated on—but ridiculous, never! And I, who have been ridiculous without being cheated on— How can I speak to my betters without stammering? I, who have been despicable, utterly despicable, Despicable in the basest and meanest sense of the word...
