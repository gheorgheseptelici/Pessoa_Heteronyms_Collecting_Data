 On this sad day my heart sadder than the day Moral and civic obligations The intricate web of duties of consequences No nothing A sad day an apathy toward everything Nothing Others travel Ive also traveled others are in the sun Ive also been in the sun or imagined I was Others have purpose or life or symmetrical ignorance Vanity happiness and sociability And they emigrate to return one day or not to return On ships that simply transport them They dont feel the death that lurks in every departure The mystery behind every arrival The horror within everything new They dont feel thats why theyre commissioners and ﬁnanciers Go dancing and work as ofﬁce employees Go to shows and meet people They dont feelwhy should they Let these clothed cattle from the stables of the Gods Go cheerfully by decked with garlands for the sacriﬁce Warmed by the sun cheerful lively and content to feel what they feel Let them go but alas Im going with them without a garland To the same destination Im going with them without the sun I feel without the life I have Im going with them without ignorance On this sad day my heart sadder than the day On this sad day every day On this very sad day
