How long its been since I could write A long poem Its been years Ive lost that capacity for rhythmic development In which idea and form Move forward together In a unity of body and soul Ive lost everything that once gave me Some sense of an inner certainty What do I have left The sun which is there without me having summoned it The day which requires no effort on my part A breeze or the caress of a breeze Making me conscious of the air And the domestic egoism of wanting nothing else But ah my Triumphal Ode With its rectilinear movement Ah my Maritime Ode With its development in strophe antistrophe and epode And my plans all my plans Which were my greatest odes of all And that Ô¨Ånal supreme impossible ode
