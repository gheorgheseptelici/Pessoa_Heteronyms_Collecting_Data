Yes it’s me, I myself, what I turned out to be, A kind of accessory or spare part of my own person, The jagged outskirts of my true emotion— I’m the one here in myself, it’s me. Whatever I was, whatever I wasn’t—it’s all in what I am. Whatever I wanted, whatever I didn’t want—all of this has shaped me. Whatever I loved, or stopped loving—in me it’s the same nostalgia. And I also have the impression—a bit inconsistent, Like a dream based on jumbled realities— That I left myself on a seat in the streetcar, To be found by whoever was going to sit down there next. And I also have the impression—a bit hazy, Like a dream one tries to remember on waking up to the dim light of dawn— That there’s something better in me than myself. Yes, I also have the impression—a bit painful, As of waking up without dreams to a day full of creditors— That I bungled everything, like tripping on a doormat, That I got everything wrong, like a suitcase without toilet articles, That I replaced myself with something at some point in my life. Enough! It’s the impression—somewhat metaphysical, Like the last sun seen in the window of a house we’re about to abandon— That it’s better to be a child than to want to fathom the world. It’s the impression of buttered bread and toys, Of a vast peace without Proserpina’s gardens, Of an enthusiasm for life, its face pressed against the window, Seeing the rain pattering outside Rather than the adult tears from having a knot in our throat. Enough, damn it, enough! It’s me, the one who got switched, The emissary with no letter or credentials, The clown who doesn’t laugh, the jester wearing someone else’s oversize suit, And the bells on his hat jingle Like little cowbells of a servitude weighing on his head. It’s me, I myself, the singsong riddle That no one can ﬁgure out in the rural sitting room after dinner. It’s me, just me, and nothing I can do about it!
