I took off the mask and looked in the mirror I was the same child I was years ago I hadnt changed at all Thats the advantage of knowing how to remove your mask Youre still the child The past that lives on The child I took off the mask and I put it back on Its better this way This way Im the mask And I return to normality as to a streetcar terminus
