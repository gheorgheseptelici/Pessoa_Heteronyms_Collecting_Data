     No I dont want anything I already said I dont want anything Dont come to me with conclusions Death is the only conclusion Dont offer me aesthetics Dont talk to me of morals Take metaphysics away from here Dont try to sell me complete systems dont bore me with the breakthroughs Of science of science my God of science Of science of the arts of modern civilization What harm did I ever do to the gods If youve got the truth you can keep it Im a technician but my technique is limited to the technical sphere Apart from which Im crazy and with every right to be so With every right to be so do you hear Leave me alone for Gods sake You want me to be married futile predictable and taxable You want me to be the opposite of this the opposite of anything If I were someone else Id go along with you all But since Im what I am lay off Go to hell without me Or let me go there by myself Why do we have to go together Dont grab me by the arm I dont like my arm being grabbed I want to be alone I already told you that I can only be alone Im sick of you wanting me to be sociable O blue skythe same one I knew as a child Perfect and empty eternal truth O gentle silent ancestral Tagus Tiny truth in which the sky is mirrored O sorrow revisited Lisbon of bygone days today You give me nothing you take nothing from me youre nothing I feel is me Leave me in peace I wont stay long for I never stay long And as long as Silence and the Abyss hold off I want to be alone
