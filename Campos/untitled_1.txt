If you want to kill yourself why dont you want to kill yourself Nows your chance I who greatly love both death and life Would kill myself too if I dared kill myself If you dare then be daring What good to you is the changing picture of outer images We call the world What good is this cinema of hours played out By actors with stock roles and gestures This colorful circus of our neverending drive to keep going What good is your inner world which you dont know Kill yourself and maybe youll ﬁnally know it End it all and maybe youll begin If youre weary of existing at least Be noble in your weariness And dont like me sing of life because youre drunk Dont like me salute death through literature Youre needed O futile shadow called man No one is needed youre not needed by anyone Without you everything will keep going without you Perhaps its worse for others that you live than if you kill yourself Perhaps your presence is more burdensome than your absence Other peoples grief Youre worried About them crying over you Dont worry they wont cry for long The impulse to live gradually stanches tears When theyre not for our own sake When theyre because of what happened to someone else especially death Since after this happens to someone nothing else will First theres anxiety the surprise of mysterys arrival And of your spoken lifes sudden absence Then theres the horror of your visible and material cofﬁn And the men in black whose profession is to be there Then the attending family heartbroken and telling jokes Mourning between the latest news from the evening papers Mingling grief over your death with the latest crime And you merely the incidental cause of that lamentation You who will be truly dead much deader than you imagine Much deader down here than you imagine Even if in the beyond you may be much more alive Next comes the black procession to the vault or grave And ﬁnally the beginning of the death of your memory At ﬁrst everyone feels relieved That the slightly irksome tragedy of your death is over Then with each passing day the conversation lightens up And life falls back into its old routine Then you are slowly forgotten Youre remembered only twice a year On you birthday and your death day Thats it Thats all Thats absolutely all Two times a year they think about you Two times a year those who loved you heave a sigh And they may sigh on the rare occasions someone mentions your name Look at yourself in the face and honestly face what we are If you want to kill yourself then kill yourself Forget your moral scruples or intellectual fears What scruples or fears inﬂuence the workings of life What chemical scruples rule the driving impulse Of sap the bloods circulation and love What memory of others exists in the joyous rhythm of life Ah vanity of ﬂesh and blood called man Cant you see that youre utterly unimportant Youre important to yourself because youre what you feel Youre everything to yourself because for you youre the universe The real universe and other people Being mere satellites of your objective subjectivity You matter to yourself because youre all that matters to you And if this is true for you O myth then wont it be true for others Do you like Hamlet dread the unknown But what is known What do you really know Such that you can call anything unknown Do you like Falstaff love life with all its fat If you love it so materially then love it even more materially By becoming a bodily part of the earth and of things Scatter yourself O physicochemical system Of nocturnally conscious cells Over the nocturnal consciousness of the unconsciousness of bodies Over the huge blanket of appearances that blankets nothing Over the grass and weeds of proliferating beings Over the atomic fog of things Over the whirling walls Of the dynamic void thats the world
