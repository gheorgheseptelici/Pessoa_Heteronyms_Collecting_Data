 IN A   Ive never known anyone who took a beating All my acquaintances have been champions at everything Whereas I so often shabby so often disgusting so often despicable I so often and undeniably a sponger Inexcusably ﬁlthy I who so often have been too lazy to take a bath I who so often have been ridiculous and absurd Who have tripped in public on the rugs of etiquette Who have been grotesque petty obsequious and arrogant Who have been humiliated and said nothing Who when Ive spoken up have been even more ridiculous I who have been the laughingstock of chambermaids Who have felt porters winking behind my back Who have been a ﬁnancial disgrace borrowing money I never paid back Who when punches were about to ﬂy ducked Out of punching range I who have anguished over the pettiest things Am convinced theres no one in the world as pathetic as me No one I know has ever done anything ridiculous No one who talks to me has ever been humiliated Theyve been princes in life every last one of them If only I could hear some other human voice Confess not to a sin but to an infamy Tell not about an act of violence but of cowardice No all the people I listen to if they talk to me are paragons Who in this wide world would admit to me that he was ever despicable O princes my brothers Ive had it up to here with demigods Where in the world are there people Am I the only one on earth whos ever wrong and despicable They may not have been loved by women They may have been cheated onbut ridiculous never And I who have been ridiculous without being cheated on How can I speak to my betters without stammering I who have been despicable utterly despicable Despicable in the basest and meanest sense of the word
