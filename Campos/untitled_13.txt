My heart the deluded admiral Who ruled a ﬂeet of neverbuilt ships Followed a route Fate wouldnt admit In search of an impossible happiness Absurd verbose always on the shelf Given to a life that merely abstains He never gave himself never gave himself never gave himself As the runon verse explains But there are advantages to a history Lived in the shadows the silence of defeat Has inner roses unknown to victory And so the admirals imperial ﬂeet Laden with yearnings and dreams of glory Followed its course with no retreat
