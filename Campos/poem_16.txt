Lisbon with its houses Of various colors, Lisbon with its houses Of various colors, Lisbon with its houses Of various colors... By virtue of being different, this is monotonous, Just as, by virtue of feeling, I do nothing but think. At night, lying down but awake In the useless lucidity of not being able to sleep, I try to imagine something But something else always appears (since I’m sleepy And, being sleepy, a bit dreamy). I try to extend the range of my imagination To fantastic, sprawling palm groves, But all I see On what seems to be the inside of my eyelids Is Lisbon with its houses Of various colors. I smile because here, lying down, it’s something else. By virtue of being monotonous, it’s different. And, by virtue of being I, I fall asleep and forget I exist. What remains, without me, whom I’ve forgotten since I’m asleep, Is Lisbon with its houses Of various colors.
