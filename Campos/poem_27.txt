SQUIB All the Lloyd Georges of Babylon Were utterly forgotten by history. The Briands of Egypt or Assyria, The Trotskys of this or that colony Of ancient Greece or Rome Are dead names, though writ in stone. Only a fool who makes poems Or a mad inventor of philosophies Or an eccentric geometrician Will survive the vast unimportance Of what’s left behind, in the dark, And which not even history remarks. O you great men of the Moment! O great and ardent glories Of those who ﬂee obscurity! Enjoy what you have and don’t think! Cherish your fame and good food, For tomorrow belongs to today’s fools!
