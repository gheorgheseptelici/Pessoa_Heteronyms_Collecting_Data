 Its been years since my last sonnet But Ill try to write one anyhow Sonnets belong to childhood and now My childhood is just a black dot Which throws me off the useless unmoving Journey of the train thats me And the sonnets like someone inhabiting For two days now my minds constant musing Thank God I still remember that It takes fourteen lines of equal length So people will know where theyre at But where people are or where I am I dont know and couldnt care less And whatever I do know can be damned
