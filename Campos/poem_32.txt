Speak softly, for this is life, Life and my consciousness of it, Because the night advances, I’m tired, I can’t sleep, And if I go to the window I see, beneath the eyelids of the beast, the stars’ many dwellings... I wore out the day hoping I’d sleep at night. Now it’s night, almost the next day. I’m sleepy. I can’t sleep. I feel, in this weariness, that I’m all of humanity. It’s a weariness that almost turns my bones into ﬂesh... We all share the same lot... Flies with caught wings, we stagger Through the world, a spider web spanning the chasm.
