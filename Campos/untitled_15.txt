I wake up in the middle of the night and its silence I seeticktockthat its four hours until morning In the despair of my insomnia I throw open the window And across the way I see the human Crisscrossed rectangle of another lit window Fraternity in the night Involuntary secret fraternity in the night Were both awake and humanity doesnt know It sleeps We have light Who are you A sick man a counterfeiter or just an insomniac like me It doesnt matter The eternal formless inﬁnite night Has only in this place the humanity of our two windows The quiet heart of our two lights In this place and time strangers to each other were all of life At the window in the back room of my apartment Feeling the damp of night on the wooden sill I lean out toward the inﬁnite and a bit toward myself Not even a rooster disturbs the still deﬁnitive silence What are you doing comrade of that lit window Am I in my insomnia dreaming life Round yellow glow of your secret window Funny you dont have electric light O kerosene lamps of my lost childhood
