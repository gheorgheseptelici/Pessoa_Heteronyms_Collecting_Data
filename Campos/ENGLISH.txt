  I broke with the sun and stars I let the world go I went far and deep with the knapsack of things I know I made the journey bought the useless found the indeÔ¨Ånite And my heart is the same as it was a sky and a desert I failed in what I was in what I wanted in what I discovered Ive no soul left for light to arouse or darkness to smother Im nothing but nausea nothing but reverie nothing but longing Im something very far removed and I keep going Just because my I feels cozy and profoundly real Stuck like a wad of spit to one of the worlds wheels
