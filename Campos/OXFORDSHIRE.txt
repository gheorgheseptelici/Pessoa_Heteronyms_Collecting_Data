 I want the good I want the bad and in the end I want nothing I toss in bed uncomfortable on my right side on my left side And on my consciousness of existing Im universally uncomfortable metaphysically uncomfortable But whats even worse is my headache Thats more serious than the meaning of the universe Once while walking in the country around Oxford I saw up ahead beyond a bend in the road A church steeple towering above the houses of a hamlet or village The photographic image of that nonevent has remained with me Like a horizontal wrinkle marring a trousers crease Today it seems relevant From the road I associated that steeple with spirituality The faith of all ages and practical charity When I arrived at the village the steeple was a steeple And whats more there it was You can be happy in Australia as long as you dont go there
