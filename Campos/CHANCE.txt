 In the street where all is chance the blonde girl chances by But no its a different one The other girl was on another street in another city and I was another I suddenly stray from the sight in front of me Im back in the other city on the other street And the other girl walks by What an advantage to have an intransigent memory Now I regret never again having seen the other girl And I regret not even having looked at this one What an advantage to have a soul thats inside out At least some verses get written Verses get written one passes for a madman and then a genius If luck will have it or even if it wont The marvel of celebrity I was saying that at least some verses get written This was with respect to a girl A blonde girl But which one There was one I saw a long time ago in another city On another sort of street And theres this one I saw a long time ago in another city On another sort of street Since all memories are the same memory Everything that was is the same death Yesterday today and maybe even tomorrow A passerby looks at me with casual curiosity Could it be that Im making verses in gestures and frowns PerhapsThe blonde g irl Its the same girl after all Everythings the same after all Only I am in some sense not the same and this is also the same
