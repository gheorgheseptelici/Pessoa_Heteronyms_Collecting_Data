All along the wharf there’s the bustle of an imminent arrival. People begin to gather around and wait. The steamer from Africa is coming into plain view. I came here to wait for no one, To watch everyone else wait, To be everyone else waiting, To be the anxious waiting of everyone else. I’m exhausted from being so many things. The latecomers are ﬁnally arriving, And I suddenly get sick of waiting, of existing, of being. I abruptly leave and am noticed by the gatekeeper, who gives me a hard, quick stare. I return to the city as if to freedom. It’s good to feel, if for no other reason, so as to stop feeling.
