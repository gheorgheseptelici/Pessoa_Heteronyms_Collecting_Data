CHESS Pawns, they go out into the peaceful night, Tired and full of ﬁctitious feelings. They’re going home, talking about nothing, Dressed in furs, coats and pelisses. As pawns, destiny only allows them One forward square per move, unless They’re given another one diagonally, On a new path, through someone else’s death. Eternal subjects of the noble pieces, Like the bishop or rook, that move far and fast, They’re suddenly overtaken by fate In their lonely march, and breathe their last. One or another, making it all the way, Redeems not his own but someone else’s life. And the game goes on, indifferent to each piece, The relentless hand moving them all alike. Then, poor creatures dressed in furs or silks, Checkmate! the game’s over and the weary hand Stows away the contest’s meaningless pieces, Since, just a game, it’s nothing in the end.
