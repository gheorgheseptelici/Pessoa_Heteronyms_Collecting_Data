Since night was falling and I expected no one, I bolted my door against the world, And my peaceful, mean little home Sank with me into a deep silence... Drunk on aloneness, talking to myself, Strolling about without a care, I was that good and true friend I can no longer ﬁnd in the friends I have. But someone suddenly knocked at the door, And an entire poem went up in smoke... It was the neighbor, reminding me About lunch tomorrow. Yes, I’ll be there. Once more bolting my door and myself, I tried to resurrect in my heart The stroll, the enthusiasm and the desire That had made me drunk on what other people are. In vain ...J ust the same furniture as always And the inevitable walls staring at me, Like a man who stopped looking at a dying ﬁre And saw no more ﬁre when he looked again.
