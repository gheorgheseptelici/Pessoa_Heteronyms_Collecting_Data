NOTHING Ah, the soft, soft playing, Like someone about to cry, Of a song that’s woven Out of artiﬁce and moonlight... Nothing to make us remember Life. A prelude of courtesies Or a smile that faded... A cold garden in the distance... And in the soul that ﬁnds it, Just the absurd echo of its empty Flight.
