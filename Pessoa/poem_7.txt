GLOSSES . Every work is in every way futile. The futile wind, stirring up futile leaves, Describes our effort and our general state. Given or achieved, everything is Fate. Calmly observe, above your own self, Lonely and inﬁnite Possibility, Which uselessly gives rise to what’s real. Hush and, unless it’s to think, don’t feel. . Neither good nor evil deﬁnes the world. Oblivious to both, the Fate we call God From the heaven we suppose is “on high” Rules neither well nor badly earth and sky. We go through life laughing and crying, The one state being a contracted face, And the other some water with a little salt. Beyond good and evil, Fate decides all. . The sun plies the sky’s twelve signs, Forever rising and forever dying In the horizons of what we see. Reality, As we know it, is where we happen to be. Fictions of our own consciousness, We’ve laid instinct and knowledge to rest. And the sun, unmoving, doesn’t even ply The twelve signs that aren’t in the sky.
