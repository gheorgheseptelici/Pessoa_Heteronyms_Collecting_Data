Amidst my anguish over who I am A thought lifts its brow straight up, Like a tower. In the vast solitude Of a soul all alone it’s as if My heart possessed knowledge and a brain. I consist of an artiﬁcial bitterness, Faithful to I don’t know what idea. Like a make-believe courtesan, I don Majestic robes in which I exist For the artiﬁcial presence of the king. Yes, all I am and want are but dreams. Everything slipped out of my slack hands. I wait forlornly, arms just hanging there— A beggar who, having spent all his hopes, Would ask for charity but doesn’t dare.
