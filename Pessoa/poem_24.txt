Ah! the anguish, the vile rage, the despair Of not being able to express With a shout, an extreme and bitter shout, The bleeding of my heart! I speak, and the words I say are mere sound. I suffer, and it’s just me. Ah! If I could only wrest from music the secret Timbre of its shout! What rage that my sorrow can’t even shout, That its shout goes no farther Than the silence, which returns, in the air Of the night ﬁlled with nothing!
