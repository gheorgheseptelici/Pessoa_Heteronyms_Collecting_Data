Everything that exists in the world Has a history Except the frogs croaking in the depths Of my memory. Every place in the world has somewhere To b e Except the pond from where this croaking Is coming. Within me a false moon rises Over rushes, And the pond appears, lit more and less By the moon. In what life, where and how, was I What I remember Thanks to the frogs croaking in the wake Of what I forget? Nothingâ€”just silence dozing among rushes. At the end Of my huge old soul the frogs croak Without me.
