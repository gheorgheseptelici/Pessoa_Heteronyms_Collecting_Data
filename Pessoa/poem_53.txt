SENHOR SILVA The barber’s son passed away, A child of just ﬁve years. I know his father—for a year now We’ve talked as he shaves my beard. When he told me the news, as much Heart as I have gave a shudder; All ﬂustered, I hugged him, And he wept on my shoulder. In this calm and stupid life, I never know how I should act. But, my God, I feel human pain! Don’t ever deny me that!
