FOG No king or law, nor war or peace, Deﬁnes with clarity and substance The dimmed splendor of the land That is Portugal wrapped in grief— Brilliance without light or warmth, Like the glow of the will-o’-the-wisp. No one knows what he wants. No one knows his own soul. No one knows what’s good or bad. (What distant yearning weeps close by?) All is uncertain and dying. All is scattered, nothing is whole. O Portugal, today you are fog... The Hour has come!
