The beautiful wondrous fable Which they told me long ago Still slumbers in my soul But is a different fable now Back then the fable told Of fairies gnomes and elves Now it tells only about Our slavishly wavering selves But when properly considered Arent elves fairies and gnomes Just the mistaken projections Of a wavering thats all our own We create what we dont have Because were sorry its missing And whatever we long to see Is what we end up seeing Later tired of that vision Which sees only whats unreal We shut up all the windows And in our souls are sealed Although the vision is gone The Ô¨Ågures that took part Still dance and in great number But only inside our heart
