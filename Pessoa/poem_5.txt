Where’s my life going, and who’s taking it there? Why do I always do what I didn’t want to do? What destiny in me keeps on marching in the darkness? What part of me that I don’t know is my guide? My destiny has a direction and a method, My life adheres to a path and a scale, But my self-awareness is the sketchy outline Of what I do and am; it isn’t me. I don’t even know myself in what I knowingly do. I never reach the end of what I do with an end in mind. The pleasure or pain I embrace isn’t what it really is. I move on, but there’s no I inside me that moves. Who am I, Lord, in your darkness and your smoke? What soul besides mine inhabits my soul? Why did you give me the feeling of a path If the path I seek I’m not seeking, if in me nothing walks Except through an effort in my steps that’s not mine, Except by a fate hidden from me in my acts? Why am I conscious if consciousness is an illusion? What am I between “what” and the facts? Close my eyes, obscure my soul’s vision! O illusions! Since I know nothing about myself or life,  I enjoy at least that nothing, without faith but calmly,  I at least sleep through living, like a forgotten beach...
