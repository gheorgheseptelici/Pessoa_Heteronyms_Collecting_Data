CHESS Pawns they go out into the peaceful night Tired and full of Ô¨Åctitious feelings Theyre going home talking about nothing Dressed in furs coats and pelisses As pawns destiny only allows them One forward square per move unless Theyre given another one diagonally On a new path through someone elses death Eternal subjects of the noble pieces Like the bishop or rook that move far and fast Theyre suddenly overtaken by fate In their lonely march and breathe their last One or another making it all the way Redeems not his own but someone elses life And the game goes on indifferent to each piece The relentless hand moving them all alike Then poor creatures dressed in furs or silks Checkmate the games over and the weary hand Stows away the contests meaningless pieces Since just a game its nothing in the end
