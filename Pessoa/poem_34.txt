Whether I’m happy or sad?... Frankly I don’t know. What does it mean to be sad? What is happiness good for? I’m neither happy nor sad. I don’t really know what I am. I’m just one more soul that exists And feels what God has ordained. So then, am I happy or sad? Thinking never ends well... For me sadness means Hardly knowing myself... But that’s what happiness is...
