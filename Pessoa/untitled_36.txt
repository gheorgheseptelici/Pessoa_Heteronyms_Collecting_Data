My wife whose name is Solitude Keeps me from being glum Ah what good it does my heart To have this nonexistent home Returning there I hear no one I dont suffer the insult of a hug And I talk out loud without anyone hearing My poems are born as I go along Lord if theres some good that Heaven Though subject to Fate can still grant Then let me be alonea Ô¨Åne silk robe To talk by myselfa lively fan
