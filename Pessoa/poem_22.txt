PASSERBY I hear a piano playing, and laughter Behind the music. I pause In my dreaming to look up: it’s from The tall building—third ﬂoor. So much joy in those young voices! It’s false? How do I know? Their pleasure makes me shiver with envy! It’s banal? I have none. They may be happy on the third ﬂoor Of that tall building. I Pass by, dreaming of that home as if Dreaming of another country.
