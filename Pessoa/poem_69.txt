There are sicknesses worse than any sickness; There are pains that don’t ache, not even in the soul, And yet they’re more painful than those that do. There are anxieties from dreams that are more real Than the ones life brings; there are sensations Felt only by imagining them That are more ours than our very own life. There are countless things that exist Without existing, that lastingly exist And lastingly are ours, they’re us... Over the muddy green of the wide river The white circumﬂexes of the seagulls... Over my soul the useless ﬂutter Of what never was nor could be, and it’s everything. Give me more wine, because life is nothing.
