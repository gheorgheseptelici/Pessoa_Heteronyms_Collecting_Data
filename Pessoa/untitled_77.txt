FOG No king or law nor war or peace DeÔ¨Ånes with clarity and substance The dimmed splendor of the land That is Portugal wrapped in grief Brilliance without light or warmth Like the glow of the willothewisp No one knows what he wants No one knows his own soul No one knows whats good or bad What distant yearning weeps close by All is uncertain and dying All is scattered nothing is whole O Portugal today you are fog The Hour has come
