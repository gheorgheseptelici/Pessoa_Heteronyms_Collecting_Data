If some day someone knocks at your door, Saying that he’s my emissary, Don’t believe it, even if it’s me, Since my lofty pride won’t even consent To knocking at the unreal door of heaven. But if, without hearing anyone knock, You should happen to open the door And ﬁnd someone there who seems to be waiting For the courage to knock, consider. That Was my emissary, and me, and what My ﬁnally desperate pride will allow. Open your door to the man who doesn’t knock!
