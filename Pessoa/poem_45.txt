Blessed rooster that sings Of the night that will be day! Itâ€™s as if you raised me up From the self in which I lay. Your pure and shrill cry Is the morning before it breaks. How glad I am for the future! The last star is already faint. Once more, thank God, I hear You shout your long, clear sound. The edge of the sky grows lighter. Why do I stop and ponder?
