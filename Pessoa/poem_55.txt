Yes, at last a certain peace... A certain ancient awareness, Felt in life’s very substance, Which tells me the soul won’t end, No matter what road it follows... Facile vision? A belief shared by many? No, Because what I feel is different. It’s a life, not a belief... It’s not the skin but the heart. Sun setting in the West, I know I’ll see a different sun tomorrow— Different, yet the same, in the East. All is illusion, but nothing lies: The Nothing that’s everything is Being.
