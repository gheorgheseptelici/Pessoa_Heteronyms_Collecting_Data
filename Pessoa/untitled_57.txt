All beauty is a dream even if it exists For beauty is always more than it is The beauty I see in you Isnt here next to me What I see in you lives where I dream Far away from here If you exist I only know it Because I just dreamed it Beauty is a music which heard In dreams overï¬‚owed into life But its not exactly life Its the life that dreamed
