FREEDOM You ask what freedom is It means not being a slave to anything whether to necessity or to chance it means compelling Fortune to play on equal terms Seneca in Epistle  to Lucilius Ah how delightful To leave a task undone To have a book to read And not even crack it Reading is a bore And studying isnt anything The sun shines golden With or without literature The river ﬂows fast or slow Without a ﬁrst edition And the breeze belonging So naturally to morning Has time its in no hurry Books are just paper painted with ink And to study is to distinguish indistinctly Between nothing and not a thing How much better when its foggy To wait for King Sebastian Whether or not he ever shows Poetry dancing and charity are great things But whats best in the world are children ﬂowers Music moonlight and the sun which only sins When it withers instead of making things grow Greater than this Is Jesus Christ Who knew nothing of ﬁnances And had no library as far as we know
