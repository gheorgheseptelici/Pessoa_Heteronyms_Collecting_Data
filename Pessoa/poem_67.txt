It was such a long time ago! I don’t even know if it was in this life... It’s painful to remember it... To be unable to remember it is torture... Yes, it was you, Or someone who today is you. Your naked foot rested On the lion crouched in front of you. This of course could never Have happened, But if it could, it would make life Less tedious. Ah, your faraway gaze! Your lips from back then! I don’t know how to love them anymore, Since I never loved them in the ﬁrst place. And all of this, which promises Huge gulfs of emotion, Is the result of me simply looking at a rug Which, like everything, is on the ﬂoor.
