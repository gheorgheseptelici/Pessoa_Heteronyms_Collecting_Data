Between my sleeping and dreaming, Between me and the one in me Who I suppose I am, A river ﬂows without end. In its meandering journeys, Such as all rivers make, It passed by other, different Shores in far-off places. It arrived at where I now live, At the house that I am today. If I dwell on myself, it passes; If I wake up, it already went by. And the one I feel I am, who dies In what links me to myself, Sleeps where the river ﬂows— That river without end.
