DIARY IN THE SHADE Do you still remember me You knew me a long time ago I was that sad child you didnt care for But then gradually got to be interested in In his anguish his sadness and something else And ended up liking almost without realizing it Remember The sad Child who played on the beach By himself quietly far away from the others And he sometimes looked over at them sadly but without regret I see that you occasionally steal a glance at me Do you remember Do you want to see if you remember Ah I understand Dont you still sense in my sad and calm face The sad child who always played far away from the others And sometimes looked at them with sad eyes but without regret I know youre watching and dont understand what sadness it is That makes me look sad It isnt regret or nostalgia disappointment or resentment NoIts the sadness Of one who in the great prenatal realm Must have received from God the Secret The secret of the worlds illusion Of the absolute emptiness of things The incurable sadness Of one who realizes that everythings pointless worthless That effort is an absurd waste And that life is a void Since disillusion always follows on the heels of illusion And Death seems to be the meaning of Life Its this but not only this that you see in my face And that makes you steal an occasional glance at me There is besides this That grim astonishment that black chill Which comes from the soul Having been told a secret of God In the prenatal realm when life Had still shown no sign of dawning And the whole of the complex luminous Universe Was an inevitable destiny yet to be fulﬁlled If this doesnt deﬁne me nothing deﬁnes me And this doesnt deﬁne me Because the Secret that God told me wasnt only this There was something else which led to my embracing The unreal dimension my delighting in it so much my knack For grasping the ungraspable and for feeling what cant be felt My inward dignity of an emperor though I have no empire My world of dreams fashioned in broad daylight Yes that is what gives My face an oldness even older than my childhood And my gaze an anxiety within my happiness You occasionally steal a glance at me And you dont understand me And you steal another glance and another and another Without God theres nothing but life And youll never be able to understand
