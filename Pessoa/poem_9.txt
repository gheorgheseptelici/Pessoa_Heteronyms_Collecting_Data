In this world where we forget, We are shadows of who we are, And the real actions we perform In the other world, where we live as souls, Are here wry grins and appearances. Night and confusion engulf Everything we know down here: Projections and scattered smoke From that ﬁre whose glow is invisible To the eyes we’re given by life. But one man or another, looking Closely, can see for a moment In the shadows and their shifting The purpose in the other world Of the actions that make him live. Thus he discovers the meaning Of what down here are just grins, And his gaze’s intuition Returns to his far-off body, Imagined and understood. Homesick shadow of that body, Though a lie, it feels the cord Connecting it to the sublime Truth that avidly casts it On the ground of space and time.
