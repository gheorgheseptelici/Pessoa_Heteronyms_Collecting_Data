SEBASTIAN, KING OF PORTUGAL A madman, yes, because I wanted greatness Such as Fortune never grants. My certainty couldn’t ﬁt in me, And so what I left on those foreign sands Is the me that I was, not am. Let others take up my madness And all that went with it. Without madness what is man But a healthy beast, A postponed corpse that breeds?    from part two / portuguese sea HORIZON O sea that preceded us, your terrors Hid coral, beaches, and forests. Tearing off the veil from night and fog, From storms withstood and from the unknown, The ships of initiation saw the Distance Burst into bloom, and the starry South shimmered. Severe line of that distant coast— As the ship draws near, a slope emerges With trees that from afar were invisible. Nearer, the land opens in sounds and colors; And, once ashore, there are birds and ﬂowers Where just a far-off, abstract line had run. To dream is to see invisible forms In the uncertain distance, and then, With intuitive thrusts of hope and will, To seek in that cold horizon Beaches, trees, birds, ﬂowers and fountains— The kisses Truth gives to those who deserve them.
