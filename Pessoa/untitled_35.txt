I want to be free and insincere With no creed duty or titled post I loathe all prisons love included Whoever would love me please dont When I cry about what really happened And sing about what isnt false Its because Ive forgotten what I feel And suppose Im someone else A wanderer through my own being I pull songs from out of the breeze And my errant soul is itself A song for singing on journeys Because a great and calming effect Of nothing having a reason to be Falls from the vacant sky like a right Onto the worthless earth like a duty Dead rain from the now clear sky still soaks The nocturnal ground and I just in time Beneath my wet clothes remember to assume The role of an acceptable social type
