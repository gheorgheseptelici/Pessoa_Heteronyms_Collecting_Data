Im a fugitive I was shut up in myself As soon as I was born But I managed to ï¬‚ee If people get tired Of being in the same place Why shouldnt they tire Of having the same self My soul seeks me out But I keep on the run And sincerely hope Ill never be found Oneness is a prison To be myself is to not be Ill live as a fugitive But live really and truly
