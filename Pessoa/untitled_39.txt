O cat playing in the street As if it were a bed I envy you your luck Because it isnt luck at all Servant of the fatal laws Governing stones and people You are ruled by instincts And feel only what you feel Thats why youre happy The nothing thats you is all yours I look at myself but Im missing I know myself its not me
