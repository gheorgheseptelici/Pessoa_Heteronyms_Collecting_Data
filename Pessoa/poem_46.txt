Happy those who don’t think, since life Is their relative and gives them shelter! Happy those who act like the animals they are! Better, instead of children, to have just faith, Which is not knowing who you are or what you want. Happy those who don’t think, for they are beings, Since being means to occupy a space And give consciousness to a place.
