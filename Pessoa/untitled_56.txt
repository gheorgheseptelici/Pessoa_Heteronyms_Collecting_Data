In the peace of night full of so much enduring And of books Ive read Reading them while dreaming feeling and musing Scarcely seeing them I raise my head thats suddenly dazed By my useless reading And I see theres peace in the night now ending But not in my heart As a child I was different To become what I am I grew up and forgot What I have today is a silence a law Have I won or lost
