Ah the anguish the vile rage the despair Of not being able to express With a shout an extreme and bitter shout The bleeding of my heart I speak and the words I say are mere sound I suffer and its just me Ah If I could only wrest from music the secret Timbre of its shout What rage that my sorrow cant even shout That its shout goes no farther Than the silence which returns in the air Of the night Ô¨Ålled with nothing
