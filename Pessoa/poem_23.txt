A piano on my street... Children playing outside... A Sunday, and the sun Shining golden with joy... My sorrow that makes me Love all that’s indeﬁnite... Though I had little in life, It pains me to have lost it. But my life already Runs deep in changes... A piano I miss hearing, Those children I miss being!
