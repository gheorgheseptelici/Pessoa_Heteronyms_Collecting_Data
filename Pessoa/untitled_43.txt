Im guided only by reason I was given no other guide The light it sheds is useless I have no other light If the worlds Creator Had wanted me to be Different from how I am Hed have made me differently He gave me eyes for seeing I look I see I believe How can I dare say Blindness would be a blessing Besides my gaze God Gave me reason for going Beyond what eyes can see The vision we call knowing If seeing is being deceived And thinking is going astray I dont know I received them From God as my truth and way
