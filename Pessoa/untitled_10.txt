Seagulls are ﬂying close to the ground They say this means its going to rain But its not raining yet Right now There are seagulls close to the ground Flyingthats all Likewise when theres happiness They say sadness is on its way Perhaps but so what If today Is full of happiness where Does sadness ﬁt in It doesnt It belongs to tomorrow When it comes then Ill be sad Today is pure and good The future Doesnt exist today Theres a wall Between us and it Enjoy what you have drunk on being Leave the future in its place Poems wine women ideals Whatever you want if its what is Is for you to enjoy Tomorrow tomorrowBe tomorrow What tomorrow brings you For now Accept be ignorant and believe Keep close to the ground but ﬂying Like the seagull
