ADVICE Surround who you dream you are with high walls. Then, wherever the garden can be seen Through the iron bars of the gate, Plant only the most cheerful ﬂowers, So that you’ll be known as a cheerful sort. Where it can’t be seen, don’t plant anything. Lay ﬂower beds, like other people have, So that passing gazes can look in At your garden as you’re going to show it. But where you’re all your own and no one Ever sees you, let wild ﬂowers spring up Spontaneously, and let the grass grow naturally. Make yourself into a well-guarded Double self, letting no one who looks in See more than a garden of who you are— A showy but private garden, behind which The native ﬂowers brush against grass So straggly that not even you see it...
