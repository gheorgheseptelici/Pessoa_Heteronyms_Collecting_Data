The harmonium faintly dyingly whines Somewhere in the shapeless dark Ah how these chance strains of music Cut to the quick of ones heart Waving trees rising sea eerie stillness Of rushes a guitar a voices moan All of this reaches the soul in its depths Where its completely alone When these sounds hurt and there is no love How hazy our essence feels Cease O ï¬‚uid consciousness Be shadow O heartfelt grief
