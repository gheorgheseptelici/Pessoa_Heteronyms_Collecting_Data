PEDROUÇOS* When I was little I didn’t know I’d grow up. Or I knew but didn’t feel it. Time at that age doesn’t exist. Each day it’s the same kitchen table With the same backyard outside, And sadness, when felt, Is sadness, but you aren’t sad. That’s how I was, And all the children in the world Were that way before me. A wooden latticework fence, Tall and fragile, Divided the huge backyard Into a vegetable garden and a lawn. My heart has become forgetful But not my eyes. Don’t steal from them, Time, spent much of his early childhood, at the house of his great-aunt Maria and her husband. The couple, who had no children, doted on their nephew. That picture in which the happy boy I was Gives me a happiness that’s still mine! Your cold ﬂowing means nothing To a man who cuddles up in memories.
