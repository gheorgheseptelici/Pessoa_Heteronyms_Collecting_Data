A gray but not cold day... A day with Seemingly no patience for being day And which only on an impulse, Out of an empty ﬁt Of duty, tempered with irony, Finally gives light to a day Just like me Or else Like my heart, A heart that’s empty Not of emotion But of pursuing a goal— A gray but not cold heart.
