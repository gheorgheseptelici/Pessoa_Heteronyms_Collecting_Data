SEBASTIAN KING OF PORTUGAL A madman yes because I wanted greatness Such as Fortune never grants My certainty couldnt ﬁt in me And so what I left on those foreign sands Is the me that I was not am Let others take up my madness And all that went with it Without madness what is man But a healthy beast A postponed corpse that breeds    from part two  portuguese sea HORIZON O sea that preceded us your terrors Hid coral beaches and forests Tearing off the veil from night and fog From storms withstood and from the unknown The ships of initiation saw the Distance Burst into bloom and the starry South shimmered Severe line of that distant coast As the ship draws near a slope emerges With trees that from afar were invisible Nearer the land opens in sounds and colors And once ashore there are birds and ﬂowers Where just a faroff abstract line had run To dream is to see invisible forms In the uncertain distance and then With intuitive thrusts of hope and will To seek in that cold horizon Beaches trees birds ﬂowers and fountains The kisses Truth gives to those who deserve them
