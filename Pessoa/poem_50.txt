I don’t know if that gentle land Forgotten on a far-ﬂung, south-sea island Is reality, a dream, or a mixture Of dream and life. It is, I know, The land we long for. There, there, Life is young and love smiles. Perhaps nonexistent palm groves And impossibly distant, tree-lined paths Give peace and shade to those who believe It’s possible to have that land. Us happy? Ah, perhaps, perhaps, In that land, when that time comes. But when dreamed of, its luster fades; Thinking of it, we soon weary of thinking. Under the palms, by the light of the moon, We feel the coldness of the moon’s glowing. There just like everywhere, everywhere, Evil doesn’t end, and good can’t endure. Not with islands at the world’s end Nor with palm groves, dreamed or real, Will our soul cure its deep malaise Or goodness enter into our heart. Everything’s in us. It’s there, there, That life is young and love smiles.
