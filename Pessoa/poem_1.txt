Swamps of yearnings brushing against my gilded soul... Distant tolling of Other Bells ...The blond wheat p aling In the ashen sunset ...My soul is seized by a bodily chill... How forever equal the Hour! ...The tops of the p alms swaying!... The leaves staring at the silence inside us ...Wi spy autumn Of a hazy bird’s singing . . . Stagnant, forgotten blue... How quiet the shout of yearning that gives this Hour claws! How my self-dread longs for something that doesn’t weep! My hands reach out to the beyond, but even as they’re reaching I see that what I desire is not what I want... Cymbals of Imperfection ...O distan tly ancient Hour Banished from its own Time-self! Receding wave that invades My ceaseless retreating into myself until I faint, So intent on the present I that I seem to forget myself!... Liquid of halos with no Was behind it, no Self inside it... The Mystery smacks of my being other ...Bur sting in the moonlight... The sentry stands very straight, but his lance planted on the ground Is still taller than he...What’s all this for? ...The ﬂat day... Climbing vines of absurdity tickling Beyonds with this Hour... Horizons shutting our eyes to space, where they are false links... Opium fanfares of future silences ...Faraway trains... Gates in the distance . . . seen through the trees . . . so utterly iron!
