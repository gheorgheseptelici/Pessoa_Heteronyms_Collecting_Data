I’m a fugitive. I was shut up in myself As soon as I was born, But I managed to ﬂee. If people get tired Of being in the same place, Why shouldn’t they tire Of having the same self? My soul seeks me out, But I keep on the run And sincerely hope I’ll never be found. Oneness is a prison. To be myself is to not be. I’ll live as a fugitive But live really and truly.
