The girls go in groups Down the road singing They sing old songs The kind that bring tears When they come to mind They sing just to sing Because others have sung    And the song theyve remembered Singing it without letup Is forever old and present In the warm boisterous sound Theres something eternal Life joy their girlishness That brings to the windows The girls who dont sing The girls who in the shadow Of promised or hopedfor love Hear their own pained voice Contained in the lyrics Laughed and shouted outside Yes that song passing by Inadvertently expresses The great and human tragedy Of loving or not loving The same endless tragedy
