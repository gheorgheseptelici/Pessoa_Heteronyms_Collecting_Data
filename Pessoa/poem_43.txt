I’m guided only by reason. I was given no other guide. The light it sheds is useless? I have no other light. If the world’s Creator Had wanted me to be Different from how I am, He’d have made me differently. He gave me eyes for seeing. I look, I see, I believe. How can I dare say: “Blindness would be a blessing”? Besides my gaze, God Gave me reason, for going Beyond what eyes can see— The vision we call knowing. If seeing is being deceived, And thinking is going astray, I don’t know. I received them From God as my truth and way.
