I want to be free and insincere, With no creed, duty, or titled post. I loathe all prisons, love included. Whoever would love me, please don’t! When I cry about what really happened And sing about what isn’t false, It’s because I’ve forgotten what I feel And suppose I’m someone else. A wanderer through my own being, I pull songs from out of the breeze, And my errant soul is itself A song for singing on journeys. Because a great and calming effect Of nothing having a reason to be Falls from the vacant sky like a right Onto the worthless earth like a duty. Dead rain from the now clear sky still soaks The nocturnal ground, and I, just in time, Beneath my wet clothes, remember to assume The role of an acceptable social type.
