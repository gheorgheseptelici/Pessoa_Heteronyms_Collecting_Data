How long its been ten years perhaps Since Ive passed by this street And yet I lived here for a time About two years or three The streets the same theres almost nothing new But if it could see me and comment It would say Hes the same but how Ive changed Thus our souls remember and forget We pass by streets and by people We pass our own selves and we end Then on the blackboard Mother Intelligence Erases the symbol and we start again
