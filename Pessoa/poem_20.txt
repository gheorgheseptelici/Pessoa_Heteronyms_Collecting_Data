ABDICATION O night eternal, call me your son And take me into your arms. Iâ€™m a king Who relinquished, willingly, My throne of dreams and tedium. My sword, which dragged my weak arms down, I surrendered to strong and steady hands, And in the anteroom I abandoned My shattered scepter and crown. My spurs that jingled to no avail And my useless coat of mail I left on the cold stone steps. I took off royalty, body and soul, And returned to the night so calm, so old, Like the landscape when the sun sets.
