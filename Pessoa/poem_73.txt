ULYSSES Myth is the nothing that is everything. The very sun that breaks through the skies Is a bright and speechless myth— God’s dead body, Naked and alive. This hero who cast anchor here, Because he never was, slowly came to exist. Without ever being, he sufﬁced us. Having never come here, He came to be our founder. Thus the legend, little by little, Seeps into reality And constantly enriches it. Life down below, half Of nothing, perishes.
