THE SCAFFOLD The time Ive spent dreaming Years and years of my life Ah how much of my past Was only the false life Of a future I imagined Here on the bank of the river I grow calm for no reason Its empty ﬂowing mirrors Cold and anonymous The life Ive lived in vain How little hope ever attains What longing is worth the wait Any childs ball Rises higher than my hope Rolls farther than my longing Waves of the river so slight That you arent even waves The hours days and years Pass quicklymere grass or snow Which die by the same sun I spent all I didnt have Im older than I am The illusion that kept me going Was a queen only on stage Once undressed her reign was over Soft sound of these slow waters Aching for shores youve passed How drowsy are the memories Of misty hopes What dreams All dreaming and life amount to What did I make of my life I found myself when already lost Impatient I let myself be As I might let a lunatic go on Believing what Id proved was wrong Dead sound of these gentle waters That ﬂow because they must Take not only my memories But also my dead hopes Dead because they must die Im already my future corpse Only a dream links me to myself The hazy and belated dream Of what I should have beena wall Around my abandoned garden Take me passing waves To the oblivion of the sea Bequeath me to what I wont be I who raised a scaffold Around the house I never built
