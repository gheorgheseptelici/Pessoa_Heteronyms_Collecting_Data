I daydream far from my cozy Selfawareness as a man I dont know who my soul is Nor does it know who I am Understand it It would take time Explain it Dont know if I can And in this misunderstanding Between who I am and what is I Theres a whole other meaning Lying between earth and sky In that gap is born the universe With suns and stars past counting It has a profound meaning Which I know Its outside me
