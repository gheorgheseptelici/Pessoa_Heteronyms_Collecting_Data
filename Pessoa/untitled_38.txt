Theres no one who loves me Hold on yes there is But its hard to feel certain About what you dont believe in It isnt out of disbelief That I dont believe for I know Im well liked Its my nature Not to believe and not to change Theres no one who loves me For this poem to exist I have no choice But to suffer this grief How sad not to be loved My poor forlorn heart Et cetera and thats the end Of this poem I thought up What I feel is another matter
