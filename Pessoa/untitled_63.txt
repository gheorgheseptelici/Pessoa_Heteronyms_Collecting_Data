Everything except boredom bores me Id like without being calm to calm down To take life every day Like a medicine One of those medicines everybody takes I aspired to so much dreamed so much That so much so much made me into nothing My hands grew cold From just waiting for the enchantment Of the love that would warm them up at last Cold empty Hands
