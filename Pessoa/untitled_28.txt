I dont know who I am right now I dream Steeped in feeling myself I sleep In this Calm hour my thought forgets its thinking My soul has no soul If I exist its wrong to know it If I Wake up I feel Im mistaken I just dont know Theres nothing I want have or remember I have no being or law A moment of consciousness between illusions Im bounded all around by phantoms Sleep on oblivious to other peoples hearts O heart belonging to no one
