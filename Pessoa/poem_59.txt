When I die and you, meadow, Become something strange to me, There will be better meadows For the better self I’ll be. And the ﬂowers that are beautiful In the ﬁelds I see down here Will be stars of many colors In the vast ﬁelds there. And perhaps my heart, seeing That other nature, more natural Than the vision that fooled us Into thinking it was real, Will, like a bird at last alighting On a branch, look back and recall This ﬂight of existence As nothing at all.
