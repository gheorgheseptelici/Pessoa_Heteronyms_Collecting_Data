O cat playing in the street As if it were a bed, I envy you your luck, Because it isn’t luck at all. Servant of the fatal laws Governing stones and people, You are ruled by instincts And feel only what you feel. That’s why you’re happy. The nothing that’s you is all yours. I look at myself but I’m missing. I know myself: it’s not me.
