The harmonium faintly, dyingly whines Somewhere in the shapeless dark. Ah, how these chance strains of music Cut to the quick of one’s heart! Waving trees, rising sea, eerie stillness Of rushes, a guitar, a voice’s moan— All of this reaches the soul in its depths, Where it’s completely alone! When these sounds hurt and there is no love, How hazy our essence feels! Cease, O ﬂuid consciousness! Be shadow, O heartfelt grief!
