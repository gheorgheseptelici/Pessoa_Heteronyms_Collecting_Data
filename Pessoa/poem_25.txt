NON NECESSE EST It’s a stage—a stage in a dream— Where the actors have nothing to do. There a smiling destiny Fuses dreaming with being. Dreamed scenery, deceive him! Action, don’t take place! Fool the one who made you, O ﬁctions of the interlude! And may the soul live in ethereal Detachment, forgetting about life, Which is womanish and plebeian, And death, which isn’t anything! [?]
