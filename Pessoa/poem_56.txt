In the peace of night, full of so much enduring And of books I’ve read, Reading them while dreaming, feeling and musing, Scarcely seeing them, I raise my head that’s suddenly dazed By my useless reading, And I see there’s peace in the night now ending, But not in my heart. As a child I was different ...To become what I am, I grew up and forgot. What I have today is a silence, a law. Have I won or lost? [ ]
