SOME RANDOM VERSES Live with nostalgia for the moment Even as you live it... We’re empty boats, blown forward Like loose strands of hair By a long and steady wind, living Without knowing what we feel or want... Let’s make ourselves aware of this As of a still pond In the midst of a torpid landscape Under a desolate sky, And may our self-awareness No longer be roused by desire... In this way, equal to the whole hour In all its sweetness, Our life, no longer us, will be Our pre-wedding: a color, A fragrance, a swaying of trees, And death won’t come early or late... What matters is that nothing matter Anymore...Whether Fate Hangs over us or quietly and obscurely Lurks in the distance Is all the same...Here’s the moment... Let’s be it . . . What good is thinking?
