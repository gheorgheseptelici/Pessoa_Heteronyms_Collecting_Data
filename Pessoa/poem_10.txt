Seagulls are ﬂying close to the ground. They say this means it’s going to rain. But it’s not raining yet. Right now There are seagulls close to the ground Flying—that’s all. Likewise, when there’s happiness, They say sadness is on its way. Perhaps, but so what? If today Is full of happiness, where Does sadness ﬁt in? It doesn’t. It belongs to tomorrow. When it comes, then I’ll be sad. Today is pure and good. The future Doesn’t exist today. There’s a wall Between us and it. Enjoy what you have, drunk on being! Leave the future in its place. Poems, wine, women, ideals— Whatever you want, if it’s what is, Is for you to enjoy. Tomorrow, tomorrow...Be, tomorrow, What tomorrow brings you. For now Accept, be ignorant, and believe. Keep close to the ground, but ﬂying, Like the seagull.
