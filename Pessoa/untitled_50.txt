I dont know if that gentle land Forgotten on a farï¬‚ung southsea island Is reality a dream or a mixture Of dream and life It is I know The land we long for There there Life is young and love smiles Perhaps nonexistent palm groves And impossibly distant treelined paths Give peace and shade to those who believe Its possible to have that land Us happy Ah perhaps perhaps In that land when that time comes But when dreamed of its luster fades Thinking of it we soon weary of thinking Under the palms by the light of the moon We feel the coldness of the moons glowing There just like everywhere everywhere Evil doesnt end and good cant endure Not with islands at the worlds end Nor with palm groves dreamed or real Will our soul cure its deep malaise Or goodness enter into our heart Everythings in us Its there there That life is young and love smiles
