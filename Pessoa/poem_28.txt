I don’t know who I am right now. I dream. Steeped in feeling myself, I sleep. In this Calm hour my thought forgets its thinking, My soul has no soul. If I exist, it’s wrong to know it. If I Wake up, I feel I’m mistaken. I just don’t know. There’s nothing I want, have, or remember. I have no being or law. A moment of consciousness between illusions, I’m bounded all around by phantoms. Sleep on, oblivious to other people’s hearts, O heart belonging to no one!
