Her very being surprises. A tall, tawny blonde, It delights me just to think Of seeing her half-ripe body. Her tall breasts resemble (Or would, were she lying down) Two hills in the early morning, Even if it isn’t dawn. And the hand of her pale arm Rests with spread ﬁngers On the curved, bulging ﬂank Of her clothed ﬁgure. She entices like a boat, Or like an orange, so sweet. When, my God, will I sail? When, O hunger, will I eat?
