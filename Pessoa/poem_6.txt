THE SCAFFOLD The time I’ve spent dreaming— Years and years of my life! Ah, how much of my past Was only the false life Of a future I imagined! Here on the bank of the river I grow calm for no reason. Its empty ﬂowing mirrors, Cold and anonymous, The life I’ve lived in vain. How little hope ever attains! What longing is worth the wait? Any child’s ball Rises higher than my hope, Rolls farther than my longing. Waves of the river, so slight That you aren’t even waves, The hours, days and years Pass quickly—mere grass or snow Which die by the same sun. I spent all I didn’t have. I’m older than I am. The illusion that kept me going Was a queen only on stage: Once undressed, her reign was over. Soft sound of these slow waters Aching for shores you’ve passed, How drowsy are the memories Of misty hopes! What dreams All dreaming and life amount to! What did I make of my life? I found myself when already lost. Impatient, I let myself be, As I might let a lunatic go on Believing what I’d proved was wrong. Dead sound of these gentle waters That ﬂow because they must, Take not only my memories But also my dead hopes— Dead, because they must die. I’m already my future corpse. Only a dream links me to myself— The hazy and belated dream Of what I should have been—a wall Around my abandoned garden. Take me, passing waves, To the oblivion of the sea! Bequeath me to what I won’t be— I, who raised a scaffold Around the house I never built.
