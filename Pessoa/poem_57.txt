All beauty is a dream, even if it exists, For beauty is always more than it is. The beauty I see in you Isn’t here, next to me. What I see in you lives where I dream, Far away from here. If you exist, I only know it Because I just dreamed it. Beauty is a music which, heard In dreams, overﬂowed into life. But it’s not exactly life: It’s the life that dreamed.
