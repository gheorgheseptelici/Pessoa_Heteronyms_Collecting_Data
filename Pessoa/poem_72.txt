COAT OF ARMS: THE SHIELDS What the Gods give they sell. The price of glory is adversity. Pity the happy, for they are only What is passing! Let those for whom enough is enough Have just enough to feel they have enough! Life is brief, the soul is vast: Having is procrastinating. God, when He deﬁned Christ With adversity and disgrace, Opposed him to Nature And anointed him Son.
