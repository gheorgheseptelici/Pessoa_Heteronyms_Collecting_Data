She sings poor reaper perhaps Believing herself to be happy She sings she reaps and her voice Full of glad and anonymous poverty Wavers like the song of a bird In the air as clean as a doorstep And there are curves in the soft tissue Of the sound her song is weaving Hearing her brings joy and sadness The ﬁeld and its toil are in her voice And she sings as if she had More reasons than life for singing Ah sing sing for no reason In me what feels is always Thinning Pour into my heart Your waving uncertain voice Ah to be you while being I To have your glad unconsciousness And be conscious of it O sky O ﬁeld O song Knowledge Is so heavy and life so brief Enter inside me Make My soul your weightless shadow And take me with you away
