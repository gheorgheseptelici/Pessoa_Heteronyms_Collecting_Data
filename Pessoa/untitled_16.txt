PEDROUÇOS When I was little I didnt know Id grow up Or I knew but didnt feel it Time at that age doesnt exist Each day its the same kitchen table With the same backyard outside And sadness when felt Is sadness but you arent sad Thats how I was And all the children in the world Were that way before me A wooden latticework fence Tall and fragile Divided the huge backyard Into a vegetable garden and a lawn My heart has become forgetful But not my eyes Dont steal from them Time Pedrouços is a neighborhood on the western edge of Lisbon where Pessoa spent much of his early childhood at the house of his greataunt Maria and her husband The couple who had no children doted on their nephew That picture in which the happy boy I was Gives me a happiness thats still mine Your cold ﬂowing means nothing To a man who cuddles up in memories
