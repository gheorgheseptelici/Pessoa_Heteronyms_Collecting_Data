My wife, whose name is Solitude, Keeps me from being glum. Ah, what good it does my heart To have this nonexistent home! Returning there, I hear no one, I don’t suffer the insult of a hug, And I talk out loud without anyone hearing: My poems are born as I go along. Lord, if there’s some good that Heaven, Though subject to Fate, can still grant, Then let me be alone—a ﬁne silk robe— To talk by myself—a lively fan.
