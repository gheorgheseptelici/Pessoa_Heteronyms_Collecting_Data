I hear the wind blowing in the night. I sense, high up in the air, the whip Of I don’t know whom hitting I don’t know what. Everything’s heard; nothing’s seen. Ah, everything is symbol and analogy. The wind that blows and this cold night Are something other than night and wind— They’re shadows of Being and of Thought. Things tell us through stories what they don’t say. I don’t know what drama I ruined by thinking— A drama the night and the wind were telling. I heard it. Thinking of it, I heard in vain. Everything softly hums, the same. The wind stops blowing, the night advances, Day begins and I exist, anonymous. But what happened was much more than this.
