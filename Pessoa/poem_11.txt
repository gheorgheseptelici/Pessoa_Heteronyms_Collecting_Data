The beautiful, wondrous fable Which they told me long ago Still slumbers in my soul But is a different fable now. Back then the fable told Of fairies, gnomes and elves; Now it tells only about Our slavishly wavering selves. But, when properly considered, Aren’t elves, fairies and gnomes Just the mistaken projections Of a wavering that’s all our own? We create what we don’t have Because we’re sorry it’s missing, And whatever we long to see Is what we end up seeing. Later, tired of that vision Which sees only what’s unreal, We shut up all the windows And in our souls are sealed. Although the vision is gone, The ﬁgures that took part Still dance, and in great number, But only inside our heart.
