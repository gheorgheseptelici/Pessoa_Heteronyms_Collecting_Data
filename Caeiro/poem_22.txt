XXXI If sometimes I say that ﬂowers smile And if I should say that rivers sing, It’s not because I think there are smiles in ﬂowers And songs in the rivers’ ﬂowing... It’s so I can help misguided men Feel the truly real existence of ﬂowers and rivers. Since I write for them to read me, I sometimes stoop To the stupidity of their senses... It isn’t right, but I excuse myself, Because I’ve only taken on this odious role, an interpreter of Nature, Because there are men who don’t grasp its language, Which is no language at all.
