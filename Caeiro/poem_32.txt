Now that I feel love, I’m interested in fragrances. It never used to interest me that ﬂowers have smell. Now I feel their fragrance as if I were seeing something new. I know they smelled before, even as I know I existed. These are things we know outwardly. But now I know with the breathing at the back of my head. Now ﬂowers have a delicious taste I can smell. Now I sometimes wake up and smell before I see.
