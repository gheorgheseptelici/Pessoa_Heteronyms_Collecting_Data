XXVIII Today I read nearly two pages In the book of a mystic poet, And I laughed as if I’d cried a lot. Mystic poets are sick philosophers, And philosophers are lunatics. Because mystic poets say that ﬂowers feel And that stones have souls And that rivers are ﬁlled with rapture in the moonlight. But ﬂowers, if they felt, wouldn’t be ﬂowers, They would be people; And if stones had souls, they would be living things, not stones; And if rivers were ﬁlled with rapture in the moonlight, Those rivers would be sick people. Only one who doesn’t know what ﬂowers and stones and rivers are Can talk about their feelings. Those who talk about the soul of stones, of ﬂowers and of rivers Are talking about themselves and their false notions. Thank God that stones are just stones, And rivers nothing but rivers, And ﬂowers merely ﬂowers. As for me, I write the prose of my verses And am satisﬁed, Because I know I understand Nature on the outside, And I don’t understand it on the inside, Because Nature has no inside. If it did, it wouldn’t be Nature.
