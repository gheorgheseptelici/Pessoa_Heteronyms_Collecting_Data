 Only Nature is divine and she is not divine If I sometimes speak of her as a person Its because I can only speak of her by using the language of men Which imposes names on things And gives them personality But things have no name or personality They just are and the sky is vast the earth wide And our heart the size of a closed Ô¨Åst Blessed am I for all I dont know Thats all I truly am I enjoy it all as one who knows that the sun exists
