You speak of civilization and how it shouldnt exist At least not as it is You say that everyone or almost everyone suffers From human life being organized in this way You say that if things were different people would suffer less You say things would be better if they were how you want them I hear you and dont listen Why would I want to listen to you Id learn nothing by listening to you If things were different theyd be different thats all If things were how you want them theyd be how you want them Ô¨Åne Too bad for you and for all who spend life Trying to invent the machine for producing happiness
