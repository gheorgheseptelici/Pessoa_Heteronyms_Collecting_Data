The moon is high up in the sky and its spring I think of you and within myself Im complete A light breeze comes to me from across the hazy ﬁelds I think of you and whisper your name Im not I Im happy Tomorrow youll come and walk with me and pick ﬂowers in the ﬁelds And Ill walk with you in the ﬁelds watching you pick ﬂowers I already see you tomorrow picking ﬂowers with me in the ﬁelds But when you come tomorrow and really walk with me and pick ﬂowers For me it will be a joy and a novelty
