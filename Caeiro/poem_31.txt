The moon is high up in the sky and it’s spring. I think of you and within myself I’m complete. A light breeze comes to me from across the hazy ﬁelds. I think of you and whisper your name. I’m not I: I’m happy. Tomorrow you’ll come and walk with me and pick ﬂowers in the ﬁelds. And I’ll walk with you in the ﬁelds watching you pick ﬂowers. I already see you tomorrow picking ﬂowers with me in the ﬁelds, But when you come tomorrow and really walk with me and pick ﬂowers, For me it will be a joy and a novelty.
