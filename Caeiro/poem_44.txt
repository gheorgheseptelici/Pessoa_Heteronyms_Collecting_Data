When it’s cold in the season for cold, to me it feels pleasant, Since, suited as I am to how things exist, What’s natural is what’s pleasant just because it’s natural. I accept life’s hardships because they’re destiny, As I accept the harsh cold in the dead of winter— Calmly and without complaint, as one who simply accepts, And ﬁnds joy in the fact of accepting, In the sublimely scientiﬁc and difﬁcult fact of accepting the inevitably natural. Aren’t the illnesses I have and the adversity I experience Just the winter of my life and person? An erratic winter, whose laws of appearing are unknown to me But that exists for me by the same sublime fatality, The same inevitable fact of being outside me, As the earth’s heat in high summer And the earth’s cold in the depths of winter. I accept because it’s my nature to accept. Like everyone, I was born subject to errors and defects, But not to the error of wanting to understand too much, Not to the error of wanting to understand only with the intelligence, Not to the defect of requiring the world To be something other than the world.
