Love is a company. I no longer know how to walk the roads alone, For I’m no longer able to walk alone. A visible thought makes me walk faster And see less, and at the same time enjoy all I see. Even her absence is something that’s with me. And I like her so much I don’t know how to desire her. If I don’t see her, I imagine her and am strong like the tall trees. But if I see her I tremble, I don’t know what’s happened to what I feel in her absence. The whole of me is like a force that abandons me. All of reality looks at me like a sunﬂower with her face in the middle.
