XIV I don’t worry about rhyme. Two trees, One next to the other, are rarely identical. I think and write the way ﬂowers have color, But how I express myself is less perfect, For I lack the divine simplicity Of being only my outer self. I look and I am moved, I am moved the way water ﬂows when the ground slopes, And my poetry is natural like the stirring of the wind...
