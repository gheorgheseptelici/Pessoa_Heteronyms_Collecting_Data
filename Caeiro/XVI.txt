 If only my life were an oxcart That creaks down the road in the morning Very early and returns by the same road To where it came from in the evening I wouldnt have to have hopes just wheels My old age wouldnt have wrinkles or white hair When I was of no more use my wheels would be removed And Id end up at the bottom of a ditch broken and overturned Or Id be made into something different And I wouldnt know what Id been made into But Im not an oxcart Im different But exactly how Im different no one would ever tell me
