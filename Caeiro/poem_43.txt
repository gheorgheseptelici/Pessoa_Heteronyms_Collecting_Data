I see in the distance a ship on the Tagus... It’s sailing downriver indifferently. Not indifferently because it ignores me And I don’t care, but indifferently Because it has no meaning Outside the exclusively shippish fact Of sailing downriver without permission from metaphysics... Downriver toward the reality of sea.
