IV This afternoon a thunderstorm Rolled down from the slopes of the sky Like a huge boulder... As when someone shakes a tablecloth From out of a high window, And the crumbs, because they fall together, Make a sound when they fall, The rain swished down from the sky And darkened the roads... As the bolts of lightning jostled space And shook the air Like a large head saying no, I don’t know why (for I wasn’t afraid), But I started to pray to St. Barbara As if I were somebody’s old aunt... Ah, by praying to St. Barbara I felt even simpler Than I think I am... I felt common and domestic, As if I’d lived my whole life Peacefully, like the garden wall, Having ideas and feelings the same way A ﬂower has scent and color... I felt like someone who could believe in St. Barbara... Ah, to be able to believe in St. Barbara! (Do those who believe in St. Barbara Think she’s like us and visible? Or what then do they think of her?) (What a sham! What do the ﬂowers, The trees and the sheep know About St. Barbara? ...The branch of a t ree, If it could think, would never Invent saints or angels... It might think that the sun Illuminates and that thunder Is a sudden noise That begins with light . . . Ah, how even the simplest men Are sick and confused and stupid Next to the sheer simplicity And healthy existence Of plants and trees!) And thinking about all this, I became less happy again... I became gloomy and out of sorts and sullen Like a day when a thunderstorm threatens all day And by night it still hasn’t struck.
