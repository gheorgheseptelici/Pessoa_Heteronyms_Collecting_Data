 Better the ï¬‚ight of the bird that passes and leaves no trace Than the passage of the animal recorded in the ground The bird passes and is forgotten which is how it should be The animal no longer there and so of no further use Uselessly shows it was there Remembrance is a betrayal of Nature Because yesterdays Nature isnt Nature What was is nothing and to remember is not to see Pass by bird pass and teach me to pass
