XLIII Better the ﬂight of the bird that passes and leaves no trace Than the passage of the animal, recorded in the ground. The bird passes and is forgotten, which is how it should be. The animal, no longer there and so of no further use, Uselessly shows it was there. Remembrance is a betrayal of Nature, Because yesterday’s Nature isn’t Nature. What was is nothing, and to remember is not to see. Pass by, bird, pass, and teach me to pass!
