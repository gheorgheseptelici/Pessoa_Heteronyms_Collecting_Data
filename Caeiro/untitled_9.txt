Beyond the bend in the road There may be a well and there may be a castle And there may be just more road I dont know and dont ask As long as Im on the road thats before the bend I look only at the road before the bend Because the road before the bend is all I can see It would do me no good to look anywhere else Or at what I cant see Lets pay attention only to where we are Theres enough beauty in being here and not somewhere else If there are people beyond the bend in the road Let them worry about whats beyond the bend in the road That for them is the road If were to arrive there when we arrive there well know For now we know only that were not there Here theres just the road before the bend and before the bend Theres the road without any bend
