Today someone read me St. Francis of Assisi. I listened and couldn’t believe my ears. How could a man who was so fond of things Never have looked at them or understood what they were? Why call water my sister if water isn’t my sister? To feel it better? I feel it better by drinking it than by calling it something— Sister, or mother, or daughter. Water is beautiful because it’s water. If I call it my sister, I can see, even as I call it that, that it’s not my sister And that it’s best to call it water, since that’s what it is, Or, better yet, not to call it anything But to drink it, to feel it on my wrists, and to look at it, Without any names.
