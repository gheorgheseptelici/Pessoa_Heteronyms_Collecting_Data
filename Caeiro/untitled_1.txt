The astonishing reality of things Is my discovery every day Each thing is what it is And its hard to explain to someone how happy this makes me And how much this sufﬁces me All it takes to be complete is to exist Ive written quite a few poems Ill no doubt write many more And this is what every poem of mine says And all my poems are different Because each thing that exists is a different way of saying this Sometimes I start looking at a stone I dont start thinking about whether it exists I dont get sidetracked calling it my sister I like it for being a stone I like it because it feels nothing I like it because its not related to me in any way At other times I hear the wind blow And I feel that it was worth being born just to hear the wind blow I dont know what people will think when they read this But I feel it must be right since I think it without any effo Or any idea of what people who hear me will think Because I think it without thoughts Because I say it the way my words say it I was once called a materialist poet And it surprised me for I didnt think I could be called anything Im not even a poet I see If what I write has any value the value isnt mine It belongs to my poems All this is absolutely independent of my will
