Unable to sleep I spent the whole night seeing her Ô¨Ågure all by itself And seeing it always in ways different from when I see her in person I fashion thoughts from my memory of how she is when she talks to me And in each thought shes a variation on her likeness To love is to think And from thinking of her so much I almost forget to feel I dont really know what I want even from her and shes all I think of My distraction is as large as life When I feel like being with her I almost prefer not being with her So as not to have to leave her afterwards And I prefer thinking about her because Im a little afraid of her as she really is I dont really know what I want and I dont even want to know what I want All I want is to think her I dont ask anything of anyone not even of her except to let me think
