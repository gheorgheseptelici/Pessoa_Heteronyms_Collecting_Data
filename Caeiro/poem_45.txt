All the opinions ever formed about Nature Never made a ﬂower bloom or a blade of grass grow. All the knowledge there is of things Was never something I could seize, like a thing. If science aspires to be true, What truer science than that of things without science? I close my eyes, and the reality of the hard earth I’m lying on Is so real that even the bones in my back feel it. Where I have shoulder blades I don’t need reason.
