When spring arrives, If I’m already dead, The ﬂowers will ﬂower in the same way And the trees will not be less green than last spring. Reality doesn’t need me. It makes me enormously happy To think that my death is of no importance whatsoever. If I knew that I would die tomorrow And that spring was the day after tomorrow, I would die happy, because spring was the day after tomorrow. If that is its time, why should it come at some other time? I like everything to be real and to be right, And I like it that way because that’s how it would be even if I didn’t like it. And so, if I die now, I’ll die happy, Because everything is real and everything is right. You can pray in Latin over my cofﬁn, if you like. If you like, you can sing and dance in a circle around it. I have no preferences for when I can no longer have preferences. What will be, when it is, is what it will be when it is.
