Hillside shepherd, so far away from me with your sheep, Is the happiness you seem to have your happiness or mine? Does the peace I feel when I see you belong to you or to me? No, shepherd, neither to you nor to me. It belongs only to peace and happiness. You don’t have it, because you don’t know you have it, And I don’t have it, because I know I do. It exists on its own, and falls on us like the sun, Which hits you on the back and warms you up, while you indifferently think about something else, And it hits me in the face and dazzles my eyes, and I think only about the sun.
