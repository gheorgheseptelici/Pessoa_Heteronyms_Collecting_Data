XXVII Only Nature is divine, and she is not divine... If I sometimes speak of her as a person It’s because I can only speak of her by using the language of men, Which imposes names on things And gives them personality. But things have no name or personality: They just are, and the sky is vast, the earth wide, And our heart the size of a closed ﬁst... Blessed am I for all I don’t know. That’s all I truly am... I enjoy it all as one who knows that the sun exists.
