You say Im something more Than a stone or a plant You say You feel you think and you know That you think and feel Do stones write poems Do plants have ideas about the world Yes theres a difference But its not the difference you suppose Because being conscious doesnt oblige me to have theories about things It only obliges me to be conscious If Im more than a stone or a plant I dont know Im different I dont know what more is or what less is Is being conscious more than being colorful It might be or might not be I know only that its different No one can prove that its more than just different I know the stone is real and the plant exists I know this because they exist I know this because my senses show it to me I know Im real as well I know this because my senses show it to me Though less clearly than they show me the stone and the plant Thats all I know Yes I write poems and the stone doesnt write poems Yes I have ideas about the world and the plant has none But stones are not poets theyre stones And plants are just plants not thinkers I can say this makes me superior to them Or I can say it makes me inferior But I say nothing I say of the stone Its a stone I say of the plant Its a plant I say of myself Its me And I say no more What more is there to say
