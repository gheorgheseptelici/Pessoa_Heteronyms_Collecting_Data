Truth, falsehood, certainty, uncertainty... The blind man there on the road also knows these words. I’m sitting near the top of the steps with my hands folded On the higher of my crossed knees. So what are truth, falsehood, certainty and uncertainty? The blind man stops on the road; I’ve taken my hands off my knee. Do truth, falsehood, certainty and uncertainty remain the same? Something changed in a part of reality—my knees and my hands. What science can explain this? The blind man continues on his way and my hands keep still. It’s no longer the same time, or the same people, or the same anything... To be real is this.
