War which inï¬‚icts suffering on the world with its squadrons Is the perfect demonstration of philosophys error War like everything human wants to change things But nothing wants to change things more than war and to change them so much And to change them so quickly But war causes death And to cause death is to disdain the universe Since it results in death war proves itself wrong Since its proven wrong all wantingtochangethings is proven wrong Lets leave the outer universe and other people where Nature put them So much pride and lack of awareness So much bustling having to do things wanting to leave a mark When his heart stops beating the commander of the squadrons Slowly returns to the outer universe In Natures direct chemistry Theres no room for thought Humanity is an uprising of slaves Humanity is a government usurped by the people Existing because usurped but erring since to usurp is to have no right Let the outer world and natural humanity be Peace to all prehuman things including those in man Peace to the wholly outer essence of the Universe
