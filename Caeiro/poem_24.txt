XXXIV I ﬁnd it so natural not to think That I sometimes start laughing, all by myself, About I don’t know quite what, but it has to do With there being people who think . . . What does my wall think about my shadow? Sometimes I wonder about this until I realize I’m wondering about things... And then I feel annoyed and out of sorts with myself, As if I’d realized my foot was asleep . . . What does one thing think about another? Nothing thinks anything. Is the earth aware of the stones and plants it contains? If it were, it would be a person, And if it were a person, it would have a person’s nature, it wouldn’t be the earth. But what does all this matter to me? If I thought about these things, I would stop seeing the trees and plants And would stop seeing the Earth, Seeing nothing but my thoughts... I would grow sad and remain in the dark. The way I am, without thinking, I have the Earth and the Sky.
