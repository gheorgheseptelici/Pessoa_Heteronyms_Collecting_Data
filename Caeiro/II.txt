 My gaze is clear like a sunï¬‚ower It is my custom to walk the roads Looking right and left And sometimes looking behind me And what I see at each moment Is what I never saw before And Im very good at noticing things Im capable of feeling the same wonder A newborn child would feel If he noticed that hed really and truly been born I feel at each moment that Ive just been born Into a completely new world I believe in the world as in a daisy Because I see it But I dont think about it Because to think is to not understand The world wasnt made for us to think about it To think is to have eyes that arent well But to look at it and to be in agreement I have no philosophy I have senses If I speak of Nature its not because I know what it is But because I love it and for that very reason Because those who love never know what they love Or why they love or what love is To love is eternal innocence And the only innocence is not to think
