You say I’m something more Than a stone or a plant. You say: “You feel, you think, and you know That you think and feel. Do stones write poems? Do plants have ideas about the world?” Yes, there’s a difference, But it’s not the difference you suppose, Because being conscious doesn’t oblige me to have theories about things; It only obliges me to be conscious. If I’m more than a stone or a plant? I don’t know. I’m different. I don’t know what more is or what less is. Is being conscious more than being colorful? It might be or might not be. I know only that it’s different. No one can prove that it’s more than just different. I know the stone is real and the plant exists. I know this because they exist. I know this because my senses show it to me. I know I’m real as well. I know this because my senses show it to me, Though less clearly than they show me the stone and the plant. That’s all I know. Yes, I write poems, and the stone doesn’t write poems. Yes, I have ideas about the world, and the plant has none. But stones are not poets, they’re stones; And plants are just plants, not thinkers. I can say this makes me superior to them Or I can say it makes me inferior. But I say nothing. I say of the stone, “It’s a stone.” I say of the plant, “It’s a plant.” I say of myself, “It’s me.” And I say no more. What more is there to say?
