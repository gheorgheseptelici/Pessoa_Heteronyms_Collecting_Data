I’m not in a hurry. In a hurry for what? The sun and moon aren’t in a hurry; they’re right. To hurry is to suppose we can overtake our legs Or leap over our shadow. No, I’m not in a hurry. If I stretch out my arm, I’ll reach exactly as far as my arm reaches And not half an inch farther. I touch where my ﬁnger touches, not where I think. I can only sit down where I am. This sounds ridiculous, like all absolutely true truths, But what’s really ridiculous is how we’re always thinking of something else, And we’re always outside it, because we’re here.
