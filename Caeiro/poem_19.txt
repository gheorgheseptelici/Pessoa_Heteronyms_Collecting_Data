XXVI Sometimes, on days of perfect and exact light, When things are as real as they can possibly be, I slowly ask myself Why I even bother to attribute Beauty to things. Does a ﬂower really have beauty? Does a fruit really have beauty? No: they have only color and form And existence. Beauty is the name of something that doesn’t exist But that I give to things in exchange for the pleasure they give me. It means nothing. So why do I say about things: they’re beautiful? Yes, even I, who live only off living, Am unwittingly visited by the lies of men Concerning things, Concerning things that simply exist. How hard to be just what we are and see nothing but the visible!
