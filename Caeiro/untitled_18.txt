When its cold in the season for cold to me it feels pleasant Since suited as I am to how things exist Whats natural is whats pleasant just because its natural I accept lifes hardships because theyre destiny As I accept the harsh cold in the dead of winter Calmly and without complaint as one who simply accepts And ﬁnds joy in the fact of accepting In the sublimely scientiﬁc and difﬁcult fact of accepting the inevitably natural Arent the illnesses I have and the adversity I experience Just the winter of my life and person An erratic winter whose laws of appearing are unknown to me But that exists for me by the same sublime fatality The same inevitable fact of being outside me As the earths heat in high summer And the earths cold in the depths of winter I accept because its my nature to accept Like everyone I was born subject to errors and defects But not to the error of wanting to understand too much Not to the error of wanting to understand only with the intelligence Not to the defect of requiring the world To be something other than the world
