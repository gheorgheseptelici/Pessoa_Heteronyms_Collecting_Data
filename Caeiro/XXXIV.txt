 I Ô¨Ånd it so natural not to think That I sometimes start laughing all by myself About I dont know quite what but it has to do With there being people who think    What does my wall think about my shadow Sometimes I wonder about this until I realize Im wondering about things And then I feel annoyed and out of sorts with myself As if Id realized my foot was asleep    What does one thing think about another Nothing thinks anything Is the earth aware of the stones and plants it contains If it were it would be a person And if it were a person it would have a persons nature it wouldnt be the earth But what does all this matter to me If I thought about these things I would stop seeing the trees and plants And would stop seeing the Earth Seeing nothing but my thoughts I would grow sad and remain in the dark The way I am without thinking I have the Earth and the Sky
