XXXVI And there are poets who are artists And they fashion their verses Like a carpenter his boards!... How sad not to know how to blossom! To have to place verse upon verse, as if building a wall, Making sure each one is right, and taking it away if it isn’t!... When the only true house is the whole Earth, Which varies and is always right and is always the same. I think about this not as one who thinks but as one who doesn’t, And I look at the ﬂowers and smile... I don’t know if they understand me Or if I understand them, But I know the truth is in them and in me And in our common divinity Of letting go and living right here on the Earth And contentedly cuddling up in the Seasons And letting the wind gently sing us to sleep And having no dreams in our slumber.
