XLIX I go inside and shut the window. The lamp is brought and I’m told good night. And my voice contentedly says good night.  this be my life, now and always: The day bright with sunshine, or gentle with rain, Or stormy as if the world were ending, The evening gentle and my eyes attentive To the people passing by my window, With my last friendly gaze going to the peaceful trees, And then, window shut and the lamp lit, Without reading or sleeping and thinking of nothing, To feel life ﬂowing through me like a river between its banks, And outside a great silence like a god who is sleeping.
