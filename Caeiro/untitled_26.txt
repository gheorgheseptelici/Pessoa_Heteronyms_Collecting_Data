The ﬁrst sign of the storm that will strike the day after tomorrow The ﬁrst clouds still white hanging low in the dull sky The storm that will strike the day after tomorrow Im certain but my certainty is a lie To be certain is to not be seeing The day after tomorrow doesnt exist This is what exists A blue sky thats a bit hazy and some white clouds on the horizon With a dark smudge underneath as if they might turn black This is what today is And since for the time being today is everything this is everything I might be deadwho knowsthe day after tomorrow In which case the storm that will strike the day after tomorrow Will be a different storm than it would be if I hadnt died I realize that the storm doesnt fall from my eyes But if Im no longer in this world the world will be different There will be one person less And the storm falling in a different world wont be the same storm In any case the storm thats going to fall will be the one falling when it falls
