XXX If you want me to have a mysticism, then ﬁne, I have one. I’m a mystic, but only with my body. My soul is simple and doesn’t think. My mysticism is not wanting to know. It’s living and not thinking about it. I don’t know what Nature is: I sing it. I live on top of a hill In a solitary, whitewashed house, And that is my deﬁnition.
