Love is a company I no longer know how to walk the roads alone For Im no longer able to walk alone A visible thought makes me walk faster And see less and at the same time enjoy all I see Even her absence is something thats with me And I like her so much I dont know how to desire her If I dont see her I imagine her and am strong like the tall trees But if I see her I tremble I dont know whats happened to what I feel in her absence The whole of me is like a force that abandons me All of reality looks at me like a sunï¬‚ower with her face in the middle
