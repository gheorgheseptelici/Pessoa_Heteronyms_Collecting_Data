XLI On certain summer days, when the dusk is falling, Even if there’s no breeze, it seems For a moment that a light breeze is passing... But the trees remain still In all the leaves of their leaves. Our senses had an illusion— The illusion of what, in that moment, would please them... Ah, our senses, such sick observers and listeners! Were we as we should be, We wouldn’t need any illusions... It would be enough for us to feel with clarity and life, Without even noticing what the senses are for... But thank God there’s imperfection in the World, Since imperfection is a thing, And the existence of mistaken people is original, And the existence of sick people makes the world interesting. If there were no imperfection, there would be one less thing, And there should be many things So that we will have a lot to see and hear For as long as our eyes and ears remain open...
