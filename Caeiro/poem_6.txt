XLVIII From the highest window of my house I wave farewell with a white handkerchief To my poems going out to humanity. And I’m neither happy nor sad. That is the fate of poems. I wrote them and must show them to everyone Because I cannot do otherwise, Even as the ﬂower can’t hide its color, Nor the river hide its ﬂowing, Nor the tree hide the fruit it bears. There they go, already far away, as if in the stagecoach, And I can’t help but feel regret Like a pain in my body. Who knows who might read them? Who knows into what hands they’ll fall? A ﬂower, I was plucked by my fate to be seen. A tree, my fruit was picked to be eaten. A river, my water’s fate was to ﬂow out of me. I submit and feel almost happy, Almost happy like a man tired of being sad. Go, go away from me! The tree passes and is scattered throughout Nature. The ﬂower wilts and its dust lasts forever. The river ﬂows into the sea and its water is forever the water that was its own. I pass and I remain, like the Universe.
