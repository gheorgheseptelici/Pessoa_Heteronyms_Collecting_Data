If, after I die, someone wants to write my biography, There’s nothing simpler. It has just two dates—the day I was born and the day I died. Between the two, all the days are mine. I’m easy to deﬁne. I saw as if damned to see. I loved things without any sentimentality. I never had a desire I couldn’t satisfy, because I was never blind. Even hearing was never more for me than an accompaniment to seeing. I understood that things are real and all of them different from each other. I understood this with my eyes, never with my mind. To understand this with my mind would be to ﬁnd them all alike. One day, like a child, I suddenly got tired. I closed my eyes and fell asleep. Besides all that, I was the only poet of Nature.
