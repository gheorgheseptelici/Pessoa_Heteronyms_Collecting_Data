 To think about God is to disobey God Since God wanted us not to know him Which is why he didnt reveal himself to us Lets be simple and calm Like the trees and streams And God will love us making us Us even as the trees are trees And the streams are streams And will give us greenness in the spring which is its season And a river to go to when we end And hell give us nothing more since to give us more would make us less us
