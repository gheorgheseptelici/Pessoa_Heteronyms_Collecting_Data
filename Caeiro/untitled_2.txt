Whoever or whatever is at the center of the world Gave me the outer world as an example of Reality And when I say this is real even of a feeling I cant help but see it in some kind of external space In a visual kind of way outside and apart from me Being real means not being inside myself My inner self doesnt have any reality I can conceive of I know the world exists but I dont know if I do Im more certain of the existence of my white house Than of the inner existence of the white houses owner I believe in my body more than in my soul Since my bodys right here in the midst of reality It can be seen by others It can touch others It can sit down and stand up Whereas my soul cant be deÔ¨Åned except by outer terms It exists for mein the moments when I think it exists By borrowing from the Worlds outer reality If the soul is more real Than the outer world as you philosopher say it is Then why was the outer world given to me as realitys prototype If my feeling is more certain Than the existence of the thing I feel Then why do I feel that thing and why does it appear Independently of me Without needing me to exist Me who am forever bound to myself forever personal and nontransferable Why do I move with other people In a world where we understand each other and coincide If the world is whats mistaken and Im the one whos right If the world is a mistake its a mistake for everybody Whereas each of us is just his own mistake Between the two the world is more in the right But why all these questions unless its because Im sick On the outer and therefore right days of my life On the days when Im perfectly naturally lucid I feel without feeling that I feel I see without knowing that I see And the Universe is never so real as then The Universe is never its not near or far from me But so sublimely notmine When in life I say its obvious do I mean only I can see it When in life I say its true do I mean its my opinion When in life I say its there do I mean its not there And why should it be any different in philosophy We live before we philosophize we exist before we know we do And the earlier fact merits at least homage and precedence Yes we are outer before we are inner Therefore we are essentially outer You say sick philosopher every philosopher that this is materialism But how can this be materialism if materialism is a philosophy If a philosophy to belong to me would have to be a philosophy of mine And none of this is mine nor am I even I
