If after I die someone wants to write my biography Theres nothing simpler It has just two datesthe day I was born and the day I died Between the two all the days are mine Im easy to deﬁne I saw as if damned to see I loved things without any sentimentality I never had a desire I couldnt satisfy because I was never blind Even hearing was never more for me than an accompaniment to seeing I understood that things are real and all of them different from each other I understood this with my eyes never with my mind To understand this with my mind would be to ﬁnd them all alike One day like a child I suddenly got tired I closed my eyes and fell asleep Besides all that I was the only poet of Nature
