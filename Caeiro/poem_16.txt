XVI If only my life were an oxcart That creaks down the road in the morning, Very early, and returns by the same road To where it came from in the evening... I wouldn’t have to have hopes, just wheels... My old age wouldn’t have wrinkles or white hair... When I was of no more use, my wheels would be removed And I’d end up at the bottom of a ditch, broken and overturned. Or I’d be made into something different And I wouldn’t know what I’d been made into... But I’m not an oxcart, I’m different. But exactly how I’m different no one would ever tell me.
