Between what I see of one ﬁeld and what I see of another ﬁeld The ﬁgure of a man passes by. His footsteps move with “him” in the same reality, But I see him and see them, and they are two separate things. The “man” moves along with his ideas, in error and a foreigner, While his footsteps move by the ancient system that makes legs walk. I look at him from afar without any opinion. How perfect in him is the substance he is: his body, His true reality with no desires or hopes, Just muscles and the right, impersonal way of using them!
