 This afternoon a thunderstorm Rolled down from the slopes of the sky Like a huge boulder As when someone shakes a tablecloth From out of a high window And the crumbs because they fall together Make a sound when they fall The rain swished down from the sky And darkened the roads As the bolts of lightning jostled space And shook the air Like a large head saying no I dont know why for I wasnt afraid But I started to pray to St Barbara As if I were somebodys old aunt Ah by praying to St Barbara I felt even simpler Than I think I am I felt common and domestic As if Id lived my whole life Peacefully like the garden wall Having ideas and feelings the same way A ﬂower has scent and color I felt like someone who could believe in St Barbara Ah to be able to believe in St Barbara Do those who believe in St Barbara Think shes like us and visible Or what then do they think of her What a sham What do the ﬂowers The trees and the sheep know About St Barbara The branch of a t ree If it could think would never Invent saints or angels It might think that the sun Illuminates and that thunder Is a sudden noise That begins with light    Ah how even the simplest men Are sick and confused and stupid Next to the sheer simplicity And healthy existence Of plants and trees And thinking about all this I became less happy again I became gloomy and out of sorts and sullen Like a day when a thunderstorm threatens all day And by night it still hasnt struck
