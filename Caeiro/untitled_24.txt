Im not in a hurry In a hurry for what The sun and moon arent in a hurry theyre right To hurry is to suppose we can overtake our legs Or leap over our shadow No Im not in a hurry If I stretch out my arm Ill reach exactly as far as my arm reaches And not half an inch farther I touch where my Ô¨Ånger touches not where I think I can only sit down where I am This sounds ridiculous like all absolutely true truths But whats really ridiculous is how were always thinking of something else And were always outside it because were here
