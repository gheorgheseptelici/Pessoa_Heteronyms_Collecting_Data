To clean and tidy up Matter... To put back all the things people cluttered up Because they didn’t understand what they were for... To straighten, like a diligent housekeeper of Reality, The curtains on the windows of Feeling And the mats before the doors of Perception... To sweep the rooms of observation And to dust off simple ideas... That’s my life, verse by verse.
