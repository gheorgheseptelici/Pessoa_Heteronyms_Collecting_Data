O ship setting out on a distant voyage, Why don’t I miss you the way other people do After you’ve vanished from sight? Because, when I don’t see you, you cease to exist. And if I feel nostalgia for what doesn’t exist, The feeling is in relationship to nothing. It’s not the ship but our own selves that we miss.
