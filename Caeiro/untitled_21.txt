Truth falsehood certainty uncertainty The blind man there on the road also knows these words Im sitting near the top of the steps with my hands folded On the higher of my crossed knees So what are truth falsehood certainty and uncertainty The blind man stops on the road Ive taken my hands off my knee Do truth falsehood certainty and uncertainty remain the same Something changed in a part of realitymy knees and my hands What science can explain this The blind man continues on his way and my hands keep still Its no longer the same time or the same people or the same anything To be real is this
