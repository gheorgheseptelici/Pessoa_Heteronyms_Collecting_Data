 If sometimes I say that ﬂowers smile And if I should say that rivers sing Its not because I think there are smiles in ﬂowers And songs in the rivers ﬂowing Its so I can help misguided men Feel the truly real existence of ﬂowers and rivers Since I write for them to read me I sometimes stoop To the stupidity of their senses It isnt right but I excuse myself Because Ive only taken on this odious role an interpreter of Nature Because there are men who dont grasp its language Which is no language at all
