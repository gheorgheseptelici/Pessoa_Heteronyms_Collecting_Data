IX I’m a keeper of sheep. The sheep are my thoughts And each thought a sensation. I think with my eyes and my ears And with my hands and feet And with my nose and mouth. To think a ﬂower is to see and smell it, And to eat a fruit is to know its meaning. That is why on a hot day When I enjoy it so much I feel sad, And I lie down in the grass And close my warm eyes, Then I feel my whole body lying down in reality, I know the truth, and I’m happy.
