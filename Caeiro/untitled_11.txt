Whats my life worth In the end I dont know what end One man says I earned three hundred thousand dollars Another man says I enjoyed three thousand days of glory Yet another says I had a clear conscience and thats enough And I should somebody ask what I did Will say Nothing except look at things Which is why I have the whole Universe in my pocket And if God should ask And what did you see in things Ill answer Just the things themselves Thats all you put there And God who after all is savvy will make me into a new kind of saint
