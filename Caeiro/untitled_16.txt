Today someone read me St Francis of Assisi I listened and couldnt believe my ears How could a man who was so fond of things Never have looked at them or understood what they were Why call water my sister if water isnt my sister To feel it better I feel it better by drinking it than by calling it something Sister or mother or daughter Water is beautiful because its water If I call it my sister I can see even as I call it that that its not my sister And that its best to call it water since thats what it is Or better yet not to call it anything But to drink it to feel it on my wrists and to look at it Without any names
