What’s my life worth? In the end (I don’t know what end) One man says: “I earned three hundred thousand dollars.” Another man says: “I enjoyed three thousand days of glory.” Yet another says: “I had a clear conscience and that’s enough.” And I, should somebody ask what I did, Will say: “Nothing except look at things, Which is why I have the whole Universe in my pocket.” And if God should ask: “And what did you see in things?” I’ll answer: “Just the things themselves. That’s all you put there.” And God, who after all is savvy, will make me into a new kind of saint.
