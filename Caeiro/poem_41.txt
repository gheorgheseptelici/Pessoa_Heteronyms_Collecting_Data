You speak of civilization and how it shouldn’t exist, At least not as it is. You say that everyone, or almost everyone, suffers From human life being organized in this way. You say that if things were different, people would suffer less. You say things would be better if they were how you want them. I hear you and don’t listen. Why would I want to listen to you? I’d learn nothing by listening to you. If things were different, they’d be different: that’s all. If things were how you want them, they’d be how you want them, ﬁne. Too bad for you and for all who spend life Trying to invent the machine for producing happiness!
