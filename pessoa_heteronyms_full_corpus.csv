0,poem_1,II My gaze is clear like a sunﬂower It is my custom to walk the roads Looking right and left And sometimes looking behind me And what I see at each moment Is what I never saw before And I m very good at noticing things I m capable of feeling the same wonder A newborn child would feel If he noticed that he d really and truly been born I feel at each moment that I ve just been born Into a completely new world I believe in the world as in a daisy Because I see it But I don t think about it Because to think is to not understand The world wasn t made for us to think about it To think is to have eyes that aren t well But to look at it and to be in agreement I have no philosophy I have senses If I speak of Nature it s not because I know what it is But because I love it and for that very reason Because those who love never know what they love Or why they love or what love is To love is eternal innocence And the only innocence is not to think,"II My gaze is clear like a sunﬂower. It is my custom to walk the roads Looking right and left And sometimes looking behind me, And what I see at each moment Is what I never saw before, And I’m very good at noticing things. I’m capable of feeling the same wonder A newborn child would feel If he noticed that he’d really and truly been born. I feel at each moment that I’ve just been born Into a completely new world... I believe in the world as in a daisy, Because I see it. But I don’t think about it, Because to think is to not understand. The world wasn’t made for us to think about it (To think is to have eyes that aren’t well) But to look at it and to be in agreement. I have no philosophy, I have senses... If I speak of Nature it’s not because I know what it is But because I love it, and for that very reason, Because those who love never know what they love Or why they love, or what love is. To love is eternal innocence, And the only innocence is not to think...

1,poem_2,IV This afternoon a thunderstorm Rolled down from the slopes of the sky Like a huge boulder As when someone shakes a tablecloth From out of a high window And the crumbs because they fall together Make a sound when they fall The rain swished down from the sky And darkened the roads As the bolts of lightning jostled space And shook the air Like a large head saying no I don t know why for I wasn t afraid But I started to pray to St Barbara As if I were somebody s old aunt Ah by praying to St Barbara I felt even simpler Than I think I am I felt common and domestic As if I d lived my whole life Peacefully like the garden wall Having ideas and feelings the same way A ﬂower has scent and color I felt like someone who could believe in St Barbara Ah to be able to believe in St Barbara Do those who believe in St Barbara Think she s like us and visible Or what then do they think of her What a sham What do the ﬂowers The trees and the sheep know About St Barbara The branch of a t ree If it could think would never Invent saints or angels It might think that the sun Illuminates and that thunder Is a sudden noise That begins with light Ah how even the simplest men Are sick and confused and stupid Next to the sheer simplicity And healthy existence Of plants and trees And thinking about all this I became less happy again I became gloomy and out of sorts and sullen Like a day when a thunderstorm threatens all day And by night it still hasn t struck,"IV This afternoon a thunderstorm Rolled down from the slopes of the sky Like a huge boulder... As when someone shakes a tablecloth From out of a high window, And the crumbs, because they fall together, Make a sound when they fall, The rain swished down from the sky And darkened the roads... As the bolts of lightning jostled space And shook the air Like a large head saying no, I don’t know why (for I wasn’t afraid), But I started to pray to St. Barbara As if I were somebody’s old aunt... Ah, by praying to St. Barbara I felt even simpler Than I think I am... I felt common and domestic, As if I’d lived my whole life Peacefully, like the garden wall, Having ideas and feelings the same way A ﬂower has scent and color... I felt like someone who could believe in St. Barbara... Ah, to be able to believe in St. Barbara! (Do those who believe in St. Barbara Think she’s like us and visible? Or what then do they think of her?) (What a sham! What do the ﬂowers, The trees and the sheep know About St. Barbara? ...The branch of a t ree, If it could think, would never Invent saints or angels... It might think that the sun Illuminates and that thunder Is a sudden noise That begins with light . . . Ah, how even the simplest men Are sick and confused and stupid Next to the sheer simplicity And healthy existence Of plants and trees!) And thinking about all this, I became less happy again... I became gloomy and out of sorts and sullen Like a day when a thunderstorm threatens all day And by night it still hasn’t struck.","['iv', 'afternoon', 'thunderstorm', 'rolled', 'slopes', 'sky', 'like', 'huge', 'boulder', 'someone', 'shakes', 'tablecloth', 'high', 'window', 'crumbs', 'fall', 'together', 'make', 'sound', 'fall', 'rain', 'swished', 'sky', 'darkened', 'roads', 'bolts', 'lightning', 'jostled', 'space', 'shook', 'air', 'like', 'large', 'head', 'saying', 'know', 'afraid', 'started', 'pray', 'st', 'barbara', 'somebody', 'old', 'aunt', 'ah', 'praying', 'st', 'barbara', 'felt', 'even', 'simpler', 'think', 'felt', 'common', 'domestic', 'lived', 'whole', 'life', 'peacefully', 'like', 'garden', 'wall', 'ideas', 'feelings', 'way', 'ﬂower', 'scent', 'color', 'felt', 'like', 'someone', 'could', 'believe', 'st', 'barbara', 'ah', 'able', 'believe', 'st', 'barbara', 'believe', 'st', 'barbara', 'think', 'like', 'us', 'visible', 'think', 'sham', 'ﬂowers', 'trees', 'sheep', 'know', 'st', 'barbara', 'branch', 'ree', 'could', 'think', 'would', 'never', 'invent', 'saints', 'angels', 'might', 'think', 'sun', 'illuminates', 'thunder', 'sudden', 'noise', 'begins', 'light', 'ah', 'even', 'simplest', 'men', 'sick', 'confused', 'stupid', 'next', 'sheer', 'simplicity', 'healthy', 'existence', 'plants', 'trees', 'thinking', 'became', 'less', 'happy', 'became', 'gloomy', 'sorts', 'sullen', 'like', 'day', 'thunderstorm', 'threatens', 'day', 'night', 'still', 'struck']",Caeiro
2,poem_3,VIII One midday in late spring I had a dream that was like a photograph I saw Jesus Christ come down to earth He came down a hillside As a child again Running and tumbling through the grass Pulling up ﬂowers to throw them back down And laughing loud enough to be heard far away He had run away from heaven He was too much like us to fake Being the second person of the Trinity In heaven everything was false and in disagreement With ﬂowers and trees and stones In heaven he always had to be serious And now and then had to become man again And get up on the cross and be forever dying With a crown full of thorns on his head A huge nail piercing his feet And even a rag around his waist Like on black Africans in illustrated books He wasn t even allowed a mother and father Like other children His father was two different people An old man named Joseph who was a carpenter And who wasn t his father And an idiotic dove The only ugly dove in the world Because it wasn t of the world and wasn t a dove And his mother gave birth to him without ever having loved She wasn t a woman she was a suitcase In which he was sent from heaven And they wanted him born only of a mother And with no father he could love and honor To preach goodness and justice One day when God was sleeping And the Holy Spirit was ﬂying about He went to the chest of miracles and stole three He used the ﬁrst to make everyone blind to his escape He used the second to make himself eternally human and a child He used the third to make an eternally cruciﬁed Christ Whom he left nailed to the cross that s in heaven And serves as the model for all the others Then he ﬂed to the sun And descended on the ﬁrst ray he could catch Today he lives with me in my village He s a simple child with a pretty laugh He wipes his nose with his right arm Splashes about in puddles Plucks ﬂowers and loves them and forgets them He throws stones at the donkeys Steals fruit from the orchards And runs away crying and screaming from the dogs And because he knows that they don t like it And that everyone thinks it s funny He runs after the girls Who walk in groups along the roads Carrying jugs on their heads And he lifts up their skirts He taught me all I know He taught me to look at things He shows me all the things there are in ﬂowers He shows me how curious stones are When we hold them in our hand And look at them slowly He speaks very badly of God He says God is a sick and stupid old man Who s always swearing And spitting on the ﬂoor The Virgin Mary spends the afternoons of eternity knitting And the Holy Spirit scratches himself with his beak And perches on the chairs getting them dirty Everything in heaven is stupid just like the Catholic Church He says God understands nothing About the things he created If he created them which I doubt he says God claims for instance that all beings sing his glory But beings don t sing anything If they sang they d be singers Beings exist that s all Which is why they re called beings And then tired of speaking badly about God The little boy Jesus falls asleep in my lap And I carry him home in my arms He lives with me in my house halfway up the hill He s the Eternal Child the god who was missing He s completely natural in his humanity He smiles and plays in his divinity And that s how I know beyond all doubt That he s truly the little boy Jesus And this child who s so human he s divine Is my daily life as a poet It s because he s always with me that I m always a p And that my briefest glance Fills me with feeling And the faintest sound whatever it is Seems to be speaking to me The New Child who lives where I live Gives one hand to me And the other to everything that exists And so the three of us go along whatever road we ﬁnd Leaping and singing and laughing And enjoying our shared secret Of knowing that in all the world There is no mystery And that everything is worthwhile The Eternal Child is always at my side The direction of my gaze is his pointing ﬁnger My happy listening to each and every sound Is him playfully tickling my ears We get along so well with each other In the company of everything That we never even think of each other But the two of us live together Intimately connected Like the right hand and the left At day s end we play jacks On the doorstep of the house With the solemnity beﬁtting a god and a poet And as if each jack Were an entire universe Such that it would be a great peril To let one fall to the ground Then I tell him stories about purely human matters And he smiles because it s all so incredible He laughs at kings and those who aren t kings And feels sorry when he hears about wars And about commerce and about ships That are ﬁnally just smoke hovering over the high seas For he knows that all of this lacks the truth Which is in a ﬂower when it ﬂowers And with the sunlight when it dapples The hills and valleys Or makes our eyes smart before whitewashed walls Then he falls asleep and I put him to bed I carry him in my arms into the house And lay him down removing his clothes Slowly and as if following a very pure And maternal ritual until he s naked He sleeps inside my soul And sometimes wakes up in the night And plays with my dreams He ﬂips some of them over in the air Piles some on top of others And claps his hands all by himself Smiling at my slumber When I die my son Let me be the child the little one Pick me up in your arms And carry me into your house Undress my tired and human self And tuck me into your bed If I wake up tell me stories So that I ll fall back asleep And give me your dreams to play with Until the dawning of that day You know will dawn This is the story of my little boy Jesus And is there any good reason Why it shouldn t be truer Than everything philosophers think And all that religions teach,"VIII One midday in late spring I had a dream that was like a photograph. I saw Jesus Christ come down to earth. He came down a hillside As a child again, Running and tumbling through the grass, Pulling up ﬂowers to throw them back down, And laughing loud enough to be heard far away. He had run away from heaven. He was too much like us to fake Being the second person of the Trinity. In heaven everything was false and in disagreement With ﬂowers and trees and stones. In heaven he always had to be serious And now and then had to become man again And get up on the cross, and be forever dying With a crown full of thorns on his head, A huge nail piercing his feet, And even a rag around his waist Like on black Africans in illustrated books. He wasn’t even allowed a mother and father Like other children. His father was two different people— An old man named Joseph who was a carpenter And who wasn’t his father, And an idiotic dove: The only ugly dove in the world, Because it wasn’t of the world and wasn’t a dove. And his mother gave birth to him without ever having loved. She wasn’t a woman: she was a suitcase In which he was sent from heaven. And they wanted him, born only of a mother And with no father he could love and honor, To preach goodness and justice! One day when God was sleeping And the Holy Spirit was ﬂying about, He went to the chest of miracles and stole three. He used the ﬁrst to make everyone blind to his escape. He used the second to make himself eternally human and a child. He used the third to make an eternally cruciﬁed Christ Whom he left nailed to the cross that’s in heaven And serves as the model for all the others. Then he ﬂed to the sun And descended on the ﬁrst ray he could catch. Today he lives with me in my village. He’s a simple child with a pretty laugh. He wipes his nose with his right arm, Splashes about in puddles, Plucks ﬂowers and loves them and forgets them. He throws stones at the donkeys, Steals fruit from the orchards, And runs away crying and screaming from the dogs. And because he knows that they don’t like it And that everyone thinks it’s funny, He runs after the girls Who walk in groups along the roads Carrying jugs on their heads, And he lifts up their skirts. He taught me all I know. He taught me to look at things. He shows me all the things there are in ﬂowers. He shows me how curious stones are When we hold them in our hand And look at them slowly. He speaks very badly of God. He says God is a sick and stupid old man Who’s always swearing And spitting on the ﬂoor. The Virgin Mary spends the afternoons of eternity knitting. And the Holy Spirit scratches himself with his beak And perches on the chairs, getting them dirty. Everything in heaven is stupid, just like the Catholic Church. He says God understands nothing About the things he created. “If he created them, which I doubt,” he says. “God claims, for instance, that all beings sing his glory, But beings don’t sing anything. If they sang, they’d be singers. Beings exist, that’s all, Which is why they’re called beings.” And then, tired of speaking badly about God, The little boy Jesus falls asleep in my lap And I carry him home in my arms. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . He lives with me in my house, halfway up the hill. He’s the Eternal Child, the god who was missing. He’s completely natural in his humanity. He smiles and plays in his divinity. And that’s how I know beyond all doubt That he’s truly the little boy Jesus. And this child who’s so human he’s divine Is my daily life as a poet. It’s because he’s always with me that I’m always a p And that my briefest glance Fills me with feeling, And the faintest sound, whatever it is, Seems to be speaking to me. The New Child who lives where I live Gives one hand to me And the other to everything that exists, And so the three of us go along whatever road we ﬁnd, Leaping and singing and laughing And enjoying our shared secret Of knowing that in all the world There is no mystery And that everything is worthwhile.

Mystic poets are sick philosophers, And philosophers are lunatics. Because mystic poets say that ﬂowers feel And that stones have souls And that rivers are ﬁlled with rapture in the moonlight. But ﬂowers, if they felt, wouldn’t be ﬂowers, They would be people; And if stones had souls, they would be living things, not stones; And if rivers were ﬁlled with rapture in the moonlight, Those rivers would be sick people. Only one who doesn’t know what ﬂowers and stones and rivers are Can talk about their feelings. Those who talk about the soul of stones, of ﬂowers and of rivers Are talking about themselves and their false notions. Thank God that stones are just stones, And rivers nothing but rivers, And ﬂowers merely ﬂowers. As for me, I write the prose of my verses And am satisﬁed, Because I know I understand Nature on the outside, And I don’t understand it on the inside, Because Nature has no inside. If it did, it wouldn’t be Nature.","['xxviii', 'today', 'read', 'nearly', 'two', 'pages', 'book', 'mystic', 'poet', 'laughed', 'cried', 'lot', 'mystic', 'poets', 'sick', 'philosophers', 'philosophers', 'lunatics', 'mystic', 'poets', 'say', 'ﬂowers', 'feel', 'stones', 'souls', 'rivers', 'ﬁlled', 'rapture', 'moonlight', 'ﬂowers', 'felt', 'ﬂowers', 'would', 'people', 'stones', 'souls', 'would', 'living', 'things', 'stones', 'rivers', 'ﬁlled', 'rapture', 'moonlight', 'rivers', 'would', 'sick', 'people', 'one', 'know', 'ﬂowers', 'stones', 'rivers', 'talk', 'feelings', 'talk', 'soul', 'stones', 'ﬂowers', 'rivers', 'talking', 'false', 'notions', 'thank', 'god', 'stones', 'stones', 'rivers', 'nothing', 'rivers', 'ﬂowers', 'merely', 'ﬂowers', 'write', 'prose', 'verses', 'satisﬁed', 'know', 'understand', 'nature', 'outside', 'understand', 'inside', 'nature', 'inside', 'nature']",Caeiro
4,poem_5,XLVI In this way or that way As it may happen or not happen Sometimes succeeding in saying what I think And at other times saying it badly and with things mixed in I keep writing my poems inadvertently As if writing were not something requiring action As if writing were something that happens to me In the same way that the sun reaches me from outside I try to say what I feel Without thinking about what I feel I try to place words right next to my idea So that I won t need a corridor Of thought leading to words I don t always manage to feel what I know I should feel Only very slowly does my thought swim across the river Weighed down as it is by the suit men forced it to wear I try to shed what I ve learned I try to forget the way I was taught to remember To scrape off the paint that was painted on my senses To uncrate my true emotions To step out of all my wrapping and be myself not Alberto Caeiro But a human animal created by Nature That s how I write wanting to feel Nature not even as a man But merely as someone who feels Nature That s how I write sometimes well sometimes badly Sometimes saying just what I want to say sometimes getting it wrong Falling down one moment and getting up the next But always continuing on my way like a stubborn blind man Even so I m somebody I m the Discoverer of Nature I m the Argonaut of true sensations I bring to the Universe a new Universe Because I bring to the Universe its own self This is what I feel and write Perfectly aware and clearly seeing That it s ﬁve o clock in the morning And that the sun although it still hasn t raised its face Over the wall of the horizon Is already showing the tips of its ﬁngers Gripping the top of the wall Of the horizon sprinkled with low hills,"XLVI In this way or that way, As it may happen or not happen, Sometimes succeeding in saying what I think And at other times saying it badly and with things mixed in, I keep writing my poems, inadvertently, As if writing were not something requiring action, As if writing were something that happens to me In the same way that the sun reaches me from outside. I try to say what I feel Without thinking about what I feel. I try to place words right next to my idea So that I won’t need a corridor Of thought leading to words. I don’t always manage to feel what I know I should feel. Only very slowly does my thought swim across the river, Weighed down as it is by the suit men forced it to wear. I try to shed what I’ve learned, I try to forget the way I was taught to remember, To scrape off the paint that was painted on my senses, To uncrate my true emotions, To step out of all my wrapping and be myself—not Alberto Caeiro But a human animal created by Nature. That’s how I write, wanting to feel Nature not even as a man But merely as someone who feels Nature. That’s how I write, sometimes well, sometimes badly, Sometimes saying just what I want to say, sometimes getting it wrong, Falling down one moment and getting up the next, But always continuing on my way like a stubborn blind man.

Being real means not being inside myself. My inner self doesn’t have any reality I can conceive of. I know the world exists, but I don’t know if I do. I’m more certain of the existence of my white house Than of the inner existence of the white house’s owner. I believe in my body more than in my soul, Since my body’s right here in the midst of reality, It can be seen by others, It can touch others, It can sit down and stand up, Whereas my soul can’t be deﬁned except by outer terms. It exists for me—in the moments when I think it exists— By borrowing from the World’s outer reality. If the soul is more real Than the outer world, as you, philosopher, say it is, Then why was the outer world given to me as reality’s prototype? If my feeling is more certain Than the existence of the thing I feel, Then why do I feel that thing and why does it appear Independently of me, Without needing me to exist— Me, who am forever bound to myself, forever personal and nontransferable? Why do I move with other people In a world where we understand each other and coincide, If the world is what’s mistaken and I’m the one who’s right? If the world is a mistake, it’s a mistake for everybody, Whereas each of us is just his own mistake. Between the two, the world is more in the right. But why all these questions, unless it’s because I’m sick? On the outer and therefore right days of my life, On the days when I’m perfectly, naturally lucid, I feel without feeling that I feel, I see without knowing that I see, And the Universe is never so real as then, The Universe is never (it’s not near or far from me But) so sublimely not-mine. When in life I say “it’s obvious,” do I mean “only I can see it”? When in life I say “it’s true,” do I mean “it’s my opinion”? When in life I say “it’s there,” do I mean “it’s not there”? And why should it be any different in philosophy? We live before we philosophize, we exist before we know we do, And the earlier fact merits at least homage and precedence. Yes, we are outer before we are inner. Therefore we are essentially outer. You say, sick philosopher, every philosopher, that this is materialism. But how can this be materialism, if materialism is a philosophy, If a philosophy, to belong to me, would have to be a philosophy of mine, And none of this is mine, nor am I even I?

Along the river Or along the road, Wherever we are, Always remaining In the same, easy Repose of living... Time passes And tells us nothing. We grow old. Let us know how, With a certain mischief, To feel ourselves go. Taking action Serves no purpose. No one can resist The atrocious god Who always devours His own children. Let us pick ﬂowers. Let us lightly Wet our hands In the calm rivers, So as to learn Some of their calmness. Sunﬂowers forever Beholding the sun, We will serenely Depart from life, Without even the regret Of having lived.

2,poem_3,THE CHESS PLAYERS I ve heard that once during I don t know What war of Persia When invaders rampaged through the City And the women screamed Two chess players kept on playing Their endless game In the shade of a leafy tree they stared At the old chessboard And next to each player was a mug of wine Solemnly ready To quench his thirst in the moments when Having made his move He could sit back and relax waiting On his opponent Houses were burning walls were torn down And coffers plundered Women were raped and propped against The crumbling walls Children pierced by spears were so much Blood in the streets But the two chess players stayed where they were Close to the city And far from its clamor and kept on playing Their game of chess Even if in the bleak wind s messages They heard the screams And upon reﬂection knew in their hearts That surely their women And their tender daughters were being raped In the nearby distance Even if in the moment they thought this A ﬂeeting shadow Passed over their hazy oblivious brows Soon their calm eyes Returned with conﬁdent attention To the old chessboard When the ivory king s in danger who cares About the ﬂesh and blood Of sisters and mothers and little children When the rook can t cover The retreat of the white queen what Does pillaging matter And when with sure hand the opponent s king Is placed in check It hardly concerns one s soul that children Are dying in the distance Even if the infuriated face Of an invading warrior Should suddenly peer over the wall and cause The solemn chess player To fall right there in a bloody heap The moment before that Was still devoted to the favorite game Of the supremely indifferent Let cities fall and people suffer Let life and freedom Perish let secure ancestral properties Be burned and uprooted But when war interrupts the game make sure The king s not in check And the most advanced of the ivory pawns Is ready to redeem the rook My brothers in loving Epicurus And in understanding him More in accord with our view than with his Let s learn from the story Of the impassive chess players how To spend our lives Let serious things scarcely matter to us And grave things weigh little And let the natural drive of instincts yield To the futile pleasure In the peaceful shade of the trees Of playing a good game Whatever we take from this useless life Be it glory or fame Love science or life itself It s worth no more Than the memory of a well played game And a match won Against a better player Glory weighs like an overlarge burden And fame like a fever Love wearies for it ardently searches Science never ﬁnds And life grieves for it knows it is passing The game of chess Completely absorbs one s heart but weighs little When lost for it s nothing Ah in the shade that unconsciously loves us And with a mug of wine At our side intent only on the useless Effort of the chess game Even if the game is only a dream And we have no partner Let s do as the Persians of this story Wherever out there Near or faraway war and our country And life are calling us Let them call in vain while we dream In the friendly shade Of our partners and the chess game dreams Of its indifference,"THE CHESS PLAYERS I’ve heard that once, during I don’t know What war of Persia, When invaders rampaged through the City And the women screamed, Two chess players kept on playing Their endless game. In the shade of a leafy tree they stared At the old chessboard, And next to each player was a mug of wine, Solemnly ready To quench his thirst in the moments when, Having made his move, He could sit back and relax, waiting On his opponent. Houses were burning, walls were torn down And coffers plundered; Women were raped and propped against The crumbling walls; Children, pierced by spears, were so much Blood in the streets... But the two chess players stayed where they were, Close to the city And far from its clamor, and kept on playing Their game of chess. Even if, in the bleak wind’s messages, They heard the screams And, upon reﬂection, knew in their hearts That surely their women And their tender daughters were being raped In the nearby distance, Even if, in the moment they thought this, A ﬂeeting shadow Passed over their hazy, oblivious brows, Soon their calm eyes Returned with conﬁdent attention To the old chessboard. When the ivory king’s in danger, who cares About the ﬂesh and blood Of sisters and mothers and little children? When the rook can’t cover The retreat of the white queen, what Does pillaging matter? And when with sure hand the opponent’s king Is placed in check, It hardly concerns one’s soul that children Are dying in the distance. Even if the infuriated face Of an invading warrior Should suddenly peer over the wall and cause The solemn chess player To fall right there in a bloody heap, The moment before that Was still devoted to the favorite game Of the supremely indifferent. Let cities fall and people suffer, Let life and freedom Perish, let secure, ancestral properties Be burned and uprooted, But when war interrupts the game, make sure The king’s not in check And the most advanced of the ivory pawns Is ready to redeem the rook. My brothers in loving Epicurus And in understanding him More in accord with our view than with his, Let’s learn from the story Of the impassive chess players how To spend our lives. Let serious things scarcely matter to us And grave things weigh little, And let the natural drive of instincts yield To the futile pleasure (In the peaceful shade of the trees) Of playing a good game. Whatever we take from this useless life, Be it glory or fame, Love, science, or life itself, It’s worth no more Than the memory of a well-played game And a match won Against a better player. Glory weighs like an overlarge burden And fame like a fever, Love wearies, for it ardently searches, Science never ﬁnds, And life grieves, for it knows it is passing... The game of chess Completely absorbs one’s heart but weighs little When lost, for it’s nothing. Ah, in the shade that unconsciously loves us And with a mug of wine At our side, intent only on the useless Effort of the chess game, Even if the game is only a dream And we have no partner, Let’s do as the Persians of this story: Wherever out there, Near or faraway, war and our country And life are calling us, Let them call in vain, while we dream In the friendly shade Of our partners, and the chess game dreams Of its indifference.

1,poem_2,TRIUMPHAL ODE By the painful light of the factory s huge electric lamps I write in a fever I write gnashing my teeth rabid for the beauty of all this For this beauty completely unknown to the ancients O wheels O gears eternal r r r r r r r Bridled convulsiveness of raging mechanisms Raging in me and outside me Through all my dissected nerves Through all the papillae of everything I feel

contemporaneous with you O machines Gaping deliriously at the engines as at a tropical landscape Great human tropics of iron and ﬁre and energy I sing I sing the present and the past and future too Because the present is all the past and all the future Plato and Virgil exist in the machines and electric lights For the simple reason that Virgil and Plato once existed and were human And bits of an Alexander the Great from perhaps the ﬁftieth century As well as atoms that will seethe in the brain of a hundredth century Aeschylus Go round these transmission belts and pistons and ﬂywheels Roaring grinding thumping humming rattling Caressing my body all over with one caress of my soul If I could express my whole being like an engine If I could be complete like a machine If I could go triumphantly through life like the latest model car If at least I could inject all this into my physical being Rip myself wide open and become pervious To all the perfumes from the oils and hot coals Of this stupendous artiﬁcial and insatiable black ﬂora Brotherhood with all dynamics Promiscuous fury of being a moving part In the cosmopolitan iron rumble Of unﬂagging trains In the freight carrying toil of ships In the slow and smooth turning of cranes In the disciplined tumult of factories And in the humming monotonic near silence of transmission belts Productive European hours wedged Between machines and practical matters Big cities that stop for a moment in cafés In cafés those oases of useless chatter Where the sounds and gestures of the Useful Crystallize and precipitate And with them the wheels cogwheels and ball bearings of Progress New soulless Minerva of wharfs and train stations New enthusiasms commensurate with the Moment Iron plated keels smiling on docksides Or raised out

passes passing without ever passing The overemphatic presence of prostitutes The interesting banality and who knows what s inside Of bourgeois ladies usually mother and daughter Walking down the street on some errand or other The falsely feminine grace of sauntering homosexuals And all the simply elegant people who parade down the street And who also after all have a soul Ah how I d love to be the pander of all this The dazzling beauty of graft and corruption Delicious ﬁnancial and diplomatic scandals Politically motivated assaults on the streets And every now and then the comet of a

3,poem_4,MARITIME ODE Alone this summer morning on the deserted wharf I look toward the bar I look toward the Indeﬁnite I look and am glad to see The tiny black ﬁgure of an incoming steamer It s still far away but distinct classic in its own way It leaves a useless trail of smoke in the air far behind it It s coming in and the morning with it and here and there Along the river maritime life begins to stir Sails are hoisted tugboats advance Small boats jut out from behind the anchored ships There s a slight breeze But my soul is with what I least see The incoming steamer Because it s with the Distance with Morning With the maritime meaning of this Hour With the sweet pain that rises in me like a queasiness Like the onset of seasickness but in my soul I look at the far off steamer with great independence of mind And in me a ﬂywheel slowly starts spinning The steamers coming in around the bar in the morning Bring to my eyes The happy and sad mystery of all who arrive and depart They bring memories of distant wharfs and other moments Of another sort of the same humanity in other ports Every landing and every sailing of a ship Is I feel it in me like my own blood Unconsciously symbolic terribly Fraught with metaphysical meanings That stir up in me the man I once was Ah every wharf is a nostalgia made of stone And when the ship shoves off And we suddenly notice a space widening Between the wharf and the ship Then I m hit by a fresh anxiety I can t explain A mist of sad feelings Glistening in the sun of my grassy anxieties Like the ﬁrst dawn lit window And it wraps me as if it were someone else s remembrance Now mysteriously mine Ah who knows who knows If I didn t already set sail from a wharf A long time ago before I ever was if I a ship In the slanting light of dawn Didn t already depart from another kind of port Who knows if long before the outer world as I know it Dawned for me I didn t already depart From a large wharf full of a few people From a large half awakened city From a huge commercial overgrown and apoplectic city As far as this is possible outside of Space and Time Yes from a wharf a wharf in some sense material Real with the form of a wharf a wharf in fact The Absolute Wharf whose model we ve unconsciously imitated Unwittingly evoked to build Our wharfs that serve our ports Our wharfs of literal stone over actual water And once they re built they strike us without warning as Real Things Spirit Things Soul Stone Beings At certain moments of root feeling When a door in the outer world seems to open And without anything changing Everything proves to be different Ah the Great Wharf from where we set sail in Nation Ships O Great Primordial Wharf eternal and divine Of what port Over what waters And why do I wonder Great Wharf like other wharfs but the only One Rustling like them with predawn silences And blossoming with morning to the noise of cranes And arriving freight trains Under an occasional thin black cloud Of smoke from nearby factories That shades the black and shiny coal sprinkled ground Like the shadow of a cloud passing over dusky waters Ah what essence of mystery and senses arrested In revelatory divine ecstasy At hours colored by silence and anxieties Forms the bridge between any wharf and The Wharf Wharf blackly reﬂected in still waters The bustle on board ships O wandering restless soul of people who live in ships Of symbolic people who come and go and for whom nothing lasts For when the ship returns to port There s always some change on board O never ending ﬂights departures drunkenness from Diversity Eternal soul of navigators and navigations Hulls slowly mirrored in the water As the ship pulls out of port To ﬂoat like life s soul to sally forth like a voice To live the moment gently tossing on eternal waters To wake up to days more immediate than Europe s To see mysterious ports bordering the sea s solitude To round far off capes and ﬁnd sudden vast landscapes Of countless startled slopes Ah the distant beaches the wharfs seen from afar And then the beaches close up the wharfs in plain view The mystery of every departure and every arrival The sad instability and inscrutability Of this impossible universe Felt more deeply in the skin with each passing maritime hour Our souls absurd sobbing Over the expanses of diverse seas with isles in the distance Over the distant islands ﬂanking the coasts not visited Over the ports that grow clearer with their houses and people As the ship approaches Ah how fresh the mornings of arrivals are And how pallid the mornings of departures When our insides tighten into a ball And a vague sensation akin to fear The ancestral fear of leaving what we know and going away The mysterious ancestral fear of Arrival and the New Makes us shrink in our skin with anxiety And the whole of our anguished body as if it were our soul Feels an inexplicable desire to feel all this In some other way There s a nostalgia for something A stirring of affection but for what uncertain country What coast What ship What wharf The thought languishes And we re left with a large inner void A hollow satiety of seaborne minutes And a vague anxiety that would be weariness or sorrow If it knew how to be either Even so the summer morning is slightly cool A slight torpor of night still wafts in the shaken air The ﬂywheel in me spins a bit faster And the steamer is coming in because I know it must be coming And not because I can see it moving at such a great distance In my imagination it s already close by and visible All up and down its rows of portholes And everything in me trembles all my muscles and ﬂesh Because of that person who never arrives in any boat And whom I ve come to wait for today because of an oblique command The ships coming in around the bar The ships setting out from ports The ships passing in the ofﬁng I imagine myself watching them from a deserted beach All these abstract ships about to depart All these ships move me as if they were more Than mere ships ships coming and going And ships seen from up close even if we re not going to embark on them Seen from below from the skiffs next to the steel broadsides Seen from inside in the cabins the lounges the storerooms Seeing up close the masts tapering high overhead Brushing against the ropes descending the cramped stairways Smelling the greasy metallic and maritime mixture of all this Ships seen from up close are something else and are the same Stirring the same nostalgia and the same yearning in another way The seafaring life All that it embraces and all that it is All of its sweet seduction ﬁlters into my blood And I daydream indeﬁnitely of voyages The distant coastlines ﬂattened by the horizon The capes islands and sandy beaches The maritime solitudes like certain moments in the Paciﬁc When by the power of some suggestion learned in school Our nerves feel the weight of its being the largest ocean And the world and the taste of things become a desert in us The splashier more human expanse of the Atlantic The Indian Ocean the most mysterious of all And the Mediterranean without mystery soft and classical a sea that washes Esplanades eyed by white statues in nearby gardens How I d love to hold all seas all straits all bays and all gulfs Against my chest feel them close and die And you O nautical things my old dream toys Be my inner life outside me Keels masts and sails helms rigging Smokestacks propellers topsails pennants Tiller ropes hatchways boilers pipes and valves Fall inside of me in a heap one big heap Like the jumbled contents of a drawer dumped out on the ﬂoor Be the treasure of my feverish greed Be the fruit of the tree of my imagination Theme of my songs blood in the v eins of my intellect The aesthetic link between me and the outside Provide me with metaphors images literature Because really and truly seriously literally My sensations are a boat with its keel in the air My imagination a half sunken anchor My yearning a broken oar And the web of my nerves a net left to dry on the beach Somewhere on the river a single whistle blows The entire ground of my psyche is now trembling The ﬂywheel in me keeps moving faster Ah the steamers the voyages the not knowing the whereabouts Of so and so a seaman of our acquaintance Ah the glory of knowing that a man who palled around with us Was drowned off an island in the Paciﬁc We who knew him will tell this to everyone With all due pride and a quiet conviction That all this has a broader and more beautiful meaning Than just the loss of the ship on which he sailed And his sinking to the bottom with his lungs full of water Ah the steamers the coal ships the sailing ships How rare alas sailing ships are becoming on the high seas I who love modern civilization and kiss machines with all my soul I the engineer and sophisticate who studied abroad Would love to see once again only wooden ships and sailing vessels To know no other seafaring life besides the ancient life of the seas For the ancient seas are Absolute Distance The Pure Faraway free of the weight of Today Ah how everything here reminds me of that better life Of those seas that were larger since navigation was slower Of those seas that were mysterious since no one knew much about them Every faraway steamer is a nearby sailing ship Every distant ship seen now is a ship from the past seen up close All the invisible sailors aboard ships on the horizon Are visible sailors from the time of the old vessels From the slow sail driven age of perilous voyages From the wood and canvas age of voyages that took months The delirium of maritime things slowly takes hold of me The wharf and its atmosphere physically penetrate me The surging of the Tagus inundates my senses And I begin to dream to be wrapped by the dream of the wat ers The transmission belts on my soul start turning hard And I m visibly shaken by the ﬂywheel s increasing speed The waters call me The oceans call me The faraway calls me with a bodily voice And it s every seafaring age there ever was calling It was you Jim Barnes English sailor and my friend Who taught me that ancient English cry Which so virulently sums up For complex souls like mine The confused call of the waters The uncanny implicit voice of all maritime things Of shipwrecks of long voyages of dangerous crossings That English cry of yours which in my blood becomes universal A cry like no other without human form or voice That tremendous cry which seems to resound Inside a cavern whose roof is the sky And seems to tell all the sinister things That can happen in the Faraway on the Sea at Night You always pretended to be calling a schooner Cupping your large dark and weathered hands On the sides of your mouth to make a megaphone crying Aho o o o o o o o o o o yyyy Schooner aho o o o o o o o o o o o o yyyy I can hear you from here now and I wake up to something The wind shudders The morning rises The heat sets in I feel my cheeks redden My conscious eyes dilate Ecstasy stirs increases ascends in me And with a blind riotous hum The ﬂywheel s restless spinning intensiﬁes O clamorous call Whose heat and fury make all my yearnings Seethe in one explosive ensemble And even my tediums all of them become dynamic An appeal made to my blood By an old love from I don t know where that returns With still enough strength to allure and pull me With still enough power to make me hate this life I live amidst the physical and psychic impermeability Of the real people all around me Ah to depart By whatever means and to whatever place To set out across the waves across unknown perils across the sea To go Far to go Wide toward Abstract Distance Indeﬁnitely through deep and mysterious nights Carried like dust by the winds by the gales To go go go once and for all All of my blood lusts for wings All of my body lurches forward I rush through my imagination in torrents I trample myself underfoot I growl I hurtle My yearnings burst into foam And my ﬂesh is a wave crashing into cliffs Thinking about this O rage Thinking about this O fury Thinking about the smallness of my life full of yearnings Suddenly tremulously extraorbitally With a vicious vast and violent rocking Of the restless ﬂywheel of my imagination The dark and sadistic libido of the strident maritime life Breaks out of me whistling hooting and raving Hey sailors look outs Hey shipmates pilots Navigators seamen mariners adventurers Hey ship captains Hey men at the helm and on the masts Men who sleep on wooden bunks Men who sleep

obscene images Fire ﬁre ﬁre inside me Blood blood blood blood My brain is bursting The world as I know it explodes in red My veins snap with the sound of cables And from deep within booms the savage

pulleys A monstrous female sea serpent gorging on your crimes And there s a symphony of incompatible and analogous sensations An orchestration in my blood of deafe ning crimes Of convulsive clamors from bloody orgies on the high sea All raging like a torrid gale through my mind A cloud of hot dust obscuring my perception So that I see and dream all this with my skin and veins only Pirates piracy vessels and the hour The maritime hour when prey are captured And the terror of the captured escapes into madness that hour With all its crimes terror vessels people sea sky clouds Breezes latitude longitude shouting voices I d like the Whole of this to be the Whole of my body suffering To be my body and my blood to form the stuff of my being in red To thrive like an itching wound in my soul s unreal ﬂesh Ah to be everything in every crime To be all the component parts Of raids on ships of slaughters and rapes To be whatever was on the spot where pillages occurred To be whatever lived or was left dead on the site of gory tragedies To be the sum total pirate of all piracy at its zenith And the ﬂesh and blood synthesis of all pirate victims in the world To be in my passive body the woman all women Ever raped killed cut and mauled by pirates To be in my submissive self the female who needs to be theirs And to feel all this all these things all at once running down my spine O my hairy and gruff heroes of adventure and crime My seafaring brutes husbands of my imagination Casual lovers of my oblique sensations I long to be That Woman who waits for you in ports For you heinous men she loves in dreams with her pirate blood For she would rage with you though only in spirit Over the naked corpses of your victims at sea For she would be with you in your crimes and in your oceanic orgy Her witch s spirit would invisibly dance around each movement Of your bodies your cutlasses your strangling hands On land she would wait for you and when you came if you came In your love s roaring she would drink all the vast Foggy and sinister perfume of your conquests And as you convulsed in ecstasy she would whistle a red and yellow sabbat Flesh torn bodies cut open and gutted the blood sp urting Now as my dream of your deeds reaches its climax I lose myself completely I stop belonging to you I am you My femininity is not just to be with you it s to be your very souls To be inside all your brutality at the time you wreaked it To imbibe deep down your consciousness of what you felt When you tinged the high sea with blood When now and then you tossed to the sharks The still living bodies of the wounded and the pink ﬂesh of children And you dragged their mothers to the deck rails to look at what happened to them To be with you in your carnage and plundering To be harmonized with you in the symphony of your pillages Ah how much and in how many ways I d like to be yours To be not only your woman not only your women not only your victims Not only your victimized men women children and ships To be not only that hour and the vessels and the waves Not only your souls your bodies your rage your property To be not only the abstract orgy of your deeds in my physical self Not only this I d like to be more than this the God that s all this I d have to be God the God of an inverted faith A monstrous and satanic God the God of a blood based pantheism To be able to ﬁll up every cranny of my imaginative fury And never exhaust my desire to identify With the each and the all and the more than all of your conquests Ah torture me to cure me Let my ﬂesh be the air your cutlasses slice Before they fall on heads and necks Let my veins be the clothes your knives rip right through My imagination the body of the women you rape My mind the deck you stand on while killing My entire life in its nervous hysterical absurd ensemble The great organism in which every act of piracy ever committed Would be a conscious cell and all of me would spin As a huge rocking putridity embodying all of this The feverish machine of my teeming visions Now spins at such frightening inordinate speed That my ﬂywheel consciousness Is just a blurry circle whirring in the air

to dusk I felt too much to be able to keep on feeling My soul is spent only an echo in me remains The ﬂywheel is slowing down My dreams lift their hands a bit from my eyes There s nothing in me but a void a desert a nocturnal sea And as soon as I feel this nocturnal sea in me Then again yet again from out of the silence Of its endless distance the vast and age old cry arises Like a lightning ﬂash of sound soothing not noisy Suddenly encompassing all the wet maritime Horizon and dark human surging in the night Like the voice of a distant siren weeping calling it rises From the depths of the Far the depths of the Sea the heart of the Abyss And on the surface like seaweed ﬂoat my broken dreams Aho o o o o o o o o o o y y Schooner aho o o o o o o o o o o o o y y Ah the freshness of dew on my exhilaration The coolness of night on my inner ocean Everything in me suddenly beholds a night at sea Full of the vast and utterly human mystery of the nocturnal waves The moon rises on the horizon And my happy childhood wells up in me like a tear My past resurfaces as if that mariner s cry Were a scent a voice the echo of a song Calling up from my past That happiness I ll never again know It was in the old peaceful house by the river My bedroom windows like the dining room windows Looked out over some low lying houses and just beyond them the river The Tagus this very same Tagus but at a point further down If today I gazed out the same windows I wouldn t gaze out the same windows That time has passed like smoke from a steamer on the high sea An inexplicable feeling of tenderness A tearful and heartfelt remorse For all those victims especially the children I dreamed of hurting when I dreamed I was a pirate of old A feeling of regret since they were my victims A soft and tender feeling since they weren t really A confused emotion bluish like a fogged window Sings old songs in my poor grieving heart Ah how could I think or dream those things How far I am from what I was a few minutes ago What hysterical feelings ﬁrst one thing then the opposite As the blond morning rises funny how my ears hear only Things that concur with this emotion the lapping of the waters The river water s gentle lapping against the wharf The sailboat passing along the river s far shore The distant Japanese blue hills The houses of Almada And whatever s soft and childlike in the early morning hours A seagull passes by And my tenderness increases But all this time I wasn t paying any attention All those things I felt were only skin deep like a caress All this time I never took my eyes off my distant dream My house by the river My childhood by the river My bedroom windows looking out onto the river at night And the peace of the moonlight scattered over the waters My old aunt who loved me because of the son she d lost My old aunt used to sing me to sleep Even though I was already too old for this The memory makes tears fall on my heart cleansing it of life And a light sea breeze wafts inside me Sometimes she sang The Good Ship Catrineta There goes the Catrineta Over the waves of the sea And at other times it was The Fair Princess with its wistful Medieval melody I recall this and her poor old voice rises in me Reminding me how little I ve thought of her since then and she loved me so much How ungrateful I ve been to her and what have I done with my life Yes The Fair Princess I d close my eyes as she sang The Fair Princess Sat in her garden And I d open my eyes just a sliver see the window full of moonlight And shut them again and in all of this I was happy The Fair Princess Sat in her garden Combing her hair With her golden comb O my childhood days a doll someone broke If I could only go back in time to that house and that affection And remain there forever forever a child and forever happy But all of this is the Past a lantern on an old street corner To remember it makes me cold and hungry for something unobtainable To think of it makes me feel an absurd regret for I don t know what O slow whirlpool of conﬂicting sensations Faint vertigo of confused things in my soul Shattered furies tender feelings like spools of thread children play with Avalanches of imagination over the eyes of my senses Tears useless tears Light breezes of contradiction grazing my soul To shake off this emotion I invoke with a conscious effort I invoke with a desperate worthless arid effort The song of the Great Pirate as he was dying Fifteen men on a dead man s chest Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum But the song is a straight line drawn crookedly inside me With a struggle I m able but through an almost literary imagination To bring back into my soul s ﬁeld of vision The rage of piracy of slaughter the almost mouth watering appetite for pillage For the frivolous slaughter of women and children For the gratuitous torture of poorer passengers merely to amuse ourselves And the sensuality of breaking and shattering the things others most cherish But I dream all this while dreading something breathing down my neck I remember how interesting it would be To hang sons before their mothers eyes But I can t help but feel like the mothers To bury alive four year old children on desert isles Taking their parents there in boats to see But I shudder remembering the son I don t have who s quietly sleeping at home I try to stir a dead yearning for sea crimes For an inquisition without the excuse of Faith Crimes without even any wrath or malice behind them Carried out mechanically not to hurt not to harm And not even to amuse ourselves but just to pass the time Like country people who play solitaire at the dining table after dinner with the tablecloth pushed to one side Just for the soothing pleasure of committing heinous crimes and thinking nothing of it Of watching suffering victims reach the brink of madness and death from pain without letting them cross it But my imagination refuses to go along A shiver runs through me And suddenly more suddenly than before from farther away and deeper down Suddenly oh the terror coursing through my veins Oh the sudden cold from the door to Mystery which opened in me and let in a draft I remember God the Transcendent in life and suddenly The old voice of the English sailor Jim Barnes whom I used to talk with Becomes in me the voice of my mysterious affection for silly things like a mother s lap and a sister s hair ribbon A voice arriving miraculously from beyond the appearance of things The faint and remote Voice that s now the Absolute Voice the Mouthless Voice Arriving from above and from within the seas nocturnal solitude Calling me calling me calling me It comes faintly as if mufﬂed but still audible From far away as if it sounded elsewhere and couldn t be heard here Like a stiﬂed sob a snuffed ﬂame a silent breath From no corner in space from no place in time The eternal cry of night the deep and confused murmur Aho o o o o o o o o o o o yyy Aho o o o o o o o o o o o o o o yyy Schooner aho o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o yy A cold chill from the soul makes my whole body shiver And I suddenly open my eyes which I hadn t closed Ah how good to emerge once and for all from my dreams To return to the real world so easy on the nerves The world on this early morning when the day s ﬁrst steamers are arriving I m no longer interested in the incoming steamer from before It s still far away Only what s close now cleanses my soul My healthy rugged pragmatic imagination Is concerned now only with useful modern things With freighters steamers and passengers With rugged immediate modern commercial real things The ﬂywheel in me is slowing down Wonderful modern maritime life Clean ﬁt and full of machines All so well ordered so spontaneously organized All the machine parts all oceangoing vessels All aspects of import and export trade activity So perfectly integrated That everything seems to happen by natural laws Nothing ever colliding with anything else Nothing has lost its poetry And now there are also machines With their poetry and this entirely new kind of life This commercial worldly intellectual and sentimental life Which the machine age has conferred on our souls Voyages are as lovely as they ever were And a ship will always be lovely just because it is a ship Travel is still travel and the faraway is where it has always been Nowhere at all thank God The ports full of every kind of steamer Large and small of various colors their portholes variously arranged And belonging to so wonderfully many shipping lines Steamers in port so individual in their separate berths So attractive in their stately calm of commercial things that ply the sea The ancient and forever Homeric sea O Ulysses The humanitarian glance of lighthouses far off in the night Or the sudden ﬂashing of a nearby lighthouse on a dark dark night How close we were to the coast And the sound of the water sings in our ear All this is as it always was but today there s commerce And the commercial destiny of the great steamers Makes me proud of my era The variety of people aboard passenger ships Fills me with the modern pride of living at a time when it s so easy For races to mix together and distances to be crossed so easy to see everything And enjoy life making a good number of dreams come true Neat orderly and modern like an ofﬁce with service windows made of latticed yellow wire My present feelings natural and discreet like gentlemen Are practical and free of hysteria ﬁlling their lungs with ocean air Like people perfectly aware of how healthy it is to breathe air from the sea The day is now deﬁnitely geared for working Everything begins to move to get organized With great immediate and natural pleasure I follow with my soul All the commercial operations needed for a shipment of goods My era is the rubber stamp appearing on all invoices And I feel that all letters from all ofﬁces Should be addressed to me A bill of lading is so distinctive And a ship captain s signature so handsome and modern The commercial formality at the beginning and end of letters Dear Sirs Messieurs Amigos e Senhores Yours faithfully Nos salutations empressées All of this isn t only human and tidy but also beautiful And it ultimately has a maritime destiny a steamer on which are loaded The goods named in the letters and invoices Life s complexity Though drawn up by people Who love hate have political passions and sometimes commit crimes The invoices are so neat so well written so independent of all that Some people look at an invoice and don t feel this Surely you felt it Cesário Verde And I feel it so humanly it makes me cry Don t try to tell me there s no poetry in business and in ofﬁces It enters through every pore I breathe it in this ocean air Because all of this concerns steamers and modern navigation Because invoices and business letters are the beginning of the story And the ships carrying the goods across the eternal sea are the end Ah and the voyages holiday voyages and other kinds Voyages on the sea where we re all companions In a special way as if a maritime mystery Brought our souls together and transformed us for a moment Into transient citizens of the same uncertain country Eternally moving over the vastness of the waters Grand hotels of the Inﬁnite O my transatlantic ships Totally and perfectly cosmopolitan for you never stay long in one place And you contain every sort of face costume and race Voyages voyagers so many different kinds So many nationalities professions and people in the world So many different directions one can take in life In this life which at heart is always always the same life So many curious faces All faces are curious And nothing makes for holiness like constantly looking at people Brotherhood is not after all a revolutionary idea It s something we learn in daily life where everything has to be tolerated And we begin to appreciate what we have to tolerate Until we nearly weep with affection for what we once tolerated Ah all this is beautiful all this is human and linked To human feelings so sociable and bourgeois So complexly simple so metaphysically sad The diversiﬁed ﬂoating life ends up educating us in humanity Poor humans Poor humans all of us I take leave of this moment in the person of this other ship Which is now setting sail It s an English tramp steamer Quite grungy as if it were a French ship With the friendly air of a seaborne proletarian And no doubt mentioned on the back page of yesterday s papers My heart goes out to the poor steamer so humble and unaffected It seems to feel responsible for something to be an honest person Faithful to some duty or other There it goes leaving its berth in front of where I m sitting on the wharf There it goes placidly passing where sailing ships once passed Long long ago To Cardiff Liverpool London It doesn t matter It does its duty As we should do ours Marvelous life Bon voyage Bon voyage Bon voyage my poor chance friend who did me the favor Of taking with you the sadness and delirium of my dreams Restoring me to life so I can watch you and see you sail aw a y Bon voyage Bon voyage That s what life is With what natural elegance so typical of morning You sail tall and straight from out of Lisbon s harbor today I feel strangely endeared and grateful to you for this For this what Who knows what Go on Sail away With a slight quiver Tch tch tch tch tch tch The ﬂywheel in me comes to a halt Sail away slow steamer sail and don t stay Sail away from me sail out of my sight Depart from inside my heart Disappear into the Faraway the Faraway the mist of God Disappear follow your destiny and leave me Who am I to weep for you and question you Who am I to speak to you and love you Who am I to be troubled by the sight of you It pushes off from the wharf the sun rises golden shines brighter Glancing off the rooftops of the buildings on the wharf The whole of this side of the city is gleaming Depart leave me become First the ship in mid river separate and distinct Then a small black ship headed toward the bar Then a hazy point on the horizon O anxiety An ever hazier point on the horizon Then nothing just me and my sadness And the great city now bathed in sunlight And the real naked hour like a wharf without ships And the slow turning of the crane like a turning compass Tracing a semicircle of I don t know what emotion In the staggered silence of my soul,"MARITIME ODE Alone this summer morning on the deserted wharf, I look toward the bar, I look toward the Indeﬁnite, I look and am glad to see The tiny black ﬁgure of an incoming steamer. It’s still far away but distinct, classic in its own way. It leaves a useless trail of smoke in the air far behind it. It’s coming in, and the morning with it, and here and there Along the river maritime life begins to stir: Sails are hoisted, tugboats advance, Small boats jut out from behind the anchored ships. There’s a slight breeze. But my soul is with what I least see, The incoming steamer, Because it’s with the Distance, with Morning, With the maritime meaning of this Hour, With the sweet pain that rises in me like a queasiness, Like the onset of seasickness, but in my soul. I look at the far-off steamer with great independence of mind, And in me a ﬂywheel slowly starts spinning. The steamers coming in around the bar in the morning Bring to my eyes The happy and sad mystery of all who arrive and depart. They bring memories of distant wharfs and other moments Of another sort of the same humanity in other ports. Every landing and every sailing of a ship Is—I feel it in me like my own blood— Unconsciously symbolic, terribly Fraught with metaphysical meanings That stir up in me the man I once was... Ah, every wharf is a nostalgia made of stone! And when the ship shoves off And we suddenly notice a space widening Between the wharf and the ship, Then I’m hit by a fresh anxiety I can’t explain, A mist of sad feelings Glistening in the sun of my grassy anxieties Like the ﬁrst dawn-lit window, And it wraps me as if it were someone else’s remembrance Now mysteriously mine. Ah, who knows, who knows If I didn’t already set sail from a wharf A long time ago, before I ever was—if I, a ship In the slanting light of dawn, Didn’t already depart from another kind of port? Who knows if, long before the outer world as I know it Dawned for me, I didn’t already depart From a large wharf full of a few people, From a large, half-awakened city, From a huge, commercial, overgrown and apoplectic city, As far as this is possible outside of Space and Time? Yes, from a wharf, a wharf in some sense material, Real, with the form of a wharf, a wharf in fact, The Absolute Wharf whose model we’ve unconsciously imitated, Unwittingly evoked, to build Our wharfs that serve our ports, Our wharfs of literal stone over actual water, And once they’re built they strike us without warning as Real Things, Spirit Things, Soul-Stone Beings, At certain moments of root feeling When a door in the outer world seems to open And, without anything changing, Everything proves to be different. Ah the Great Wharf from where we set sail in Nation-Ships! O Great Primordial Wharf, eternal and divine! Of what port? Over what waters? And why do I wonder? Great Wharf like other wharfs, but the only One. Rustling, like them, with predawn silences And blossoming with morning to the noise of cranes And arriving freight trains, Under an occasional, thin black cloud Of smoke from nearby factories That shades the black and shiny, coal-sprinkled ground Like the shadow of a cloud passing over dusky waters... Ah, what essence of mystery and senses arrested In revelatory divine ecstasy At hours colored by silence and anxieties Forms the bridge between any wharf and The Wharf! Wharf blackly reﬂected in still waters, The bustle on board ships, O wandering, restless soul of people who live in ships, Of symbolic people who come and go, and for whom nothing lasts, For when the ship returns to port There’s always some change on board! O never-ending ﬂights, departures, drunkenness from Diversity! Eternal soul of navigators and navigations! Hulls slowly mirrored in the water As the ship pulls out of port! To ﬂoat like life’s soul, to sally forth like a voice, To live the moment gently tossing on eternal waters, To wake up to days more immediate than Europe’s, To see mysterious ports bordering the sea’s solitude, To round far-off capes and ﬁnd sudden vast landscapes Of countless startled slopes... Ah, the distant beaches, the wharfs seen from afar, And then the beaches close up, the wharfs in plain view. The mystery of every departure and every arrival, The sad instability and inscrutability Of this impossible universe Felt more deeply in the skin with each passing maritime hour! Our souls’ absurd sobbing Over the expanses of diverse seas with isles in the distance, Over the distant islands ﬂanking the coasts not visited, Over the ports that grow clearer with their houses and people As the ship approaches. Ah, how fresh the mornings of arrivals are, And how pallid the mornings of departures, When our insides tighten into a ball And a vague sensation akin to fear —The ancestral fear of leaving what we know and going away, The mysterious ancestral fear of Arrival and the New— Makes us shrink in our skin with anxiety. And the whole of our anguished body, as if it were our soul, Feels an inexplicable desire to feel all this In some other way. There’s a nostalgia for something, A stirring of affection, but for what uncertain country? What coast? What ship? What wharf? The thought languishes, And we’re left with a large inner void, A hollow satiety of seaborne minutes, And a vague anxiety that would be weariness or sorrow If it knew how to be either... Even so, the summer morning is slightly cool. A slight torpor of night still wafts in the shaken air. The ﬂywheel in me spins a bit faster. And the steamer is coming in, because I know it must be coming And not because I can see it moving at such a great distance. In my imagination it’s already close by and visible All up and down its rows of portholes, And everything in me trembles, all my muscles and ﬂesh, Because of that person who never arrives in any boat And whom I’ve come to wait for today, because of an oblique command. The ships coming in around the bar, The ships setting out from ports, The ships passing in the ofﬁng (I imagine myself watching them from a deserted beach), All these abstract ships about to depart— All these ships move me as if they were more Than mere ships, ships coming and going. And ships seen from up close, even if we’re not going to embark on them, Seen from below, from the skiffs, next to the steel broadsides, Seen from inside, in the cabins, the lounges, the storerooms, Seeing up close the masts tapering high overhead, Brushing against the ropes, descending the cramped stairways, Smelling the greasy metallic and maritime mixture of all this— Ships seen from up close are something else and are the same, Stirring the same nostalgia and the same yearning in another way. The seafaring life! All that it embraces and all that it is! All of its sweet seduction ﬁlters into my blood, And I daydream indeﬁnitely of voyages. The distant coastlines, ﬂattened by the horizon! The capes, islands, and sandy beaches! The maritime solitudes, like certain moments in the Paciﬁc When by the power of some suggestion learned in school Our nerves feel the weight of its being the largest ocean, And the world and the taste of things become a desert in us! The splashier, more human expanse of the Atlantic! The Indian Ocean, the most mysterious of all! And the Mediterranean, without mystery, soft and classical, a sea that washes Esplanades eyed by white statues in nearby gardens! How I’d love to hold all seas, all straits, all bays and all gulfs Against my chest, feel them close, and die! And you, O nautical things, my old dream toys! Be my inner life, outside me! Keels, masts and sails, helms, rigging, Smokestacks, propellers, topsails, pennants, Tiller ropes, hatchways, boilers, pipes and valves, Fall inside of me in a heap, one big heap, Like the jumbled contents of a drawer dumped out on the ﬂoor! Be the treasure of my feverish greed, Be the fruit of the tree of my imagination, Theme of my songs, blood in the v eins of my intellect, The aesthetic link between me and the outside! Provide me with metaphors, images, literature, Because really and truly, seriously, literally, My sensations are a boat with its keel in the air, My imagination a half-sunken anchor, My yearning a broken oar, And the web of my nerves a net left to dry on the beach! Somewhere on the river a single whistle blows. The entire ground of my psyche is now trembling. The ﬂywheel in me keeps moving faster. Ah, the steamers, the voyages, the not-knowing-the- whereabouts Of so-and-so, a seaman of our acquaintance! Ah, the glory of knowing that a man who palled around with us Was drowned off an island in the Paciﬁc! We who knew him will tell this to everyone With all due pride and a quiet conviction That all this has a broader and more beautiful meaning Than just the loss of the ship on which he sailed And his sinking to the bottom with his lungs full of water! Ah, the steamers, the coal ships, the sailing ships! How rare, alas! sailing ships are becoming on the high seas! I who love modern civilization and kiss machines with all my soul, I the engineer and sophisticate who studied abroad, Would love to see once again only wooden ships and sailing vessels, To know no other seafaring life besides the ancient life of the seas! For the ancient seas are Absolute Distance, The Pure Faraway, free of the weight of Today... Ah, how everything here reminds me of that better life, Of those seas that were larger, since navigation was slower, Of those seas that were mysterious, since no one knew much about them! Every faraway steamer is a nearby sailing ship. Every distant ship seen now is a ship from the past seen up close. All the invisible sailors aboard ships on the horizon Are visible sailors from the time of the old vessels, From the slow, sail-driven age of perilous voyages, From the wood and canvas age of voyages that took months. The delirium of maritime things slowly takes hold of me, The wharf and its atmosphere physically penetrate me, The surging of the Tagus inundates my senses, And I begin to dream, to be wrapped by the dream of the wat ers , The transmission belts on my soul start turning hard, And I’m visibly shaken by the ﬂywheel’s increasing speed. The waters call me, The oceans call me, The faraway calls me with a bodily voice, And it’s every seafaring age there ever was, calling. It was you, Jim Barnes, English sailor and my friend, Who taught me that ancient English cry Which so virulently sums up For complex souls like mine The confused call of the waters, The uncanny, implicit voice of all maritime things, Of shipwrecks, of long voyages, of dangerous crossings. That English cry of yours, which in my blood becomes universal, A cry like no other, without human form or voice, That tremendous cry which seems to resound Inside a cavern whose roof is the sky And seems to tell all the sinister things That can happen in the Faraway, on the Sea, at Night... (You always pretended to be calling a schooner, Cupping your large, dark and weathered hands On the sides of your mouth to make a megaphone, crying: Aho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o o-o-o----yyyy... Schooner aho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o----yyyy ...) I can hear you from here, now, and I wake up to something. The wind shudders. The morning rises. The heat sets in. I feel my cheeks redden. My conscious eyes dilate. Ecstasy stirs, increases, ascends in me. And with a blind, riotous hum The ﬂywheel’s restless spinning intensiﬁes. O clamorous call Whose heat and fury make all my yearnings Seethe in one explosive ensemble, And even my tediums—all of them!—become dynamic... An appeal made to my blood By an old love from I don’t know where that returns With still enough strength to allure and pull me, With still enough power to make me hate this life I live amidst the physical and psychic impermeability Of the real people all around me! Ah, to depart! By whatever means and to whatever place! To set out across the waves, across unknown perils, across the sea! To go Far, to go Wide, toward Abstract Distance, Indeﬁnitely, through deep and mysterious nights, Carried like dust by the winds, by the gales! To go, go, go once and for all! All of my blood lusts for wings! All of my body lurches forward! I rush through my imagination in torrents! I trample myself underfoot, I growl, I hurtle! My yearnings burst into foam And my ﬂesh is a wave crashing into cliffs! Thinking about this—O rage! Thinking about this—O fury! Thinking about the smallness of my life full of yearnings, Suddenly, tremulously, extraorbitally, With a vicious, vast and violent rocking Of the restless ﬂywheel of my imagination, The dark and sadistic libido of the strident maritime life Breaks out of me whistling, hooting, and raving. Hey sailors, look-outs! Hey shipmates, pilots! Navigators, seamen, mariners, adventurers! Hey ship captains! Hey men at the helm and on the masts! Men who sleep on wooden bunks! Men who sleep with Danger peeking through the portholes! Men who sleep with Death for a pillow! Men who have decks and bridges from where they can gaze Upon the vast vastness of the vast sea! Hey crane operators! Hey sail trimmers, stokers, cabin boys! Men who load cargo in the holds! Men who coil ropes on deck! Men who polish the hardware of the hatches! Men at the helm! men on the engines! men on the masts! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Men with peaked caps! Men in mesh undershirts! Men with anchors and crossed ﬂags embroidered on their chests! Tattooed men! Men with pipes! Men on the gunwales! Swarthy from so much sun, shriveled from so much rain, Clear-eyed from so much vastness all around them, Bold-faced from so much wind having pounded them! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Men who’ve seen Patagonia! Men who’ve been to Australia! Men who’ve feasted your eyes on coasts I’ll never see! Who’ve landed in lands where I’ll never set foot! Who bought primitive goods in colonies at the fore of hinterlands! And you did all of this as if it were nothing, As if this were natural, As if life were simply this, As if you weren’t even fulﬁlling a destiny! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Men of today’s ocean! Men of yesterday’s ocean! Pursers! Galley slaves! Combatants at Lepanto! Pirates from Roman times! Mariners from Greece! Phoenicians! Carthaginians! Portuguese launched from Sagres Into an uncertain adventure, onto the Absolute Sea, to achieve the Impossible! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Men who erected stone pillars and gave names to capes! Men who traded for the ﬁrst time with black people! Who ﬁrst sold slaves from new lands! Who bestowed the ﬁrst European spasm on startled Negro women! Who brought back gold, beads, fragrant woods, arrows, From hillsides bursting with lush vegetation! Men who pillaged peaceful African villages, Who put the natives to ﬂight with booming cannons, Who killed, who robbed, who tortured, who won The reward of New Things for rushing headlong Into the mystery of new seas! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey! I salute all of you in one man, and one man in all of you, All of you mixed together, all intermingled, All of you bloody, violent, hated, feared, fabled, I salute you, I salute you, I salute you! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Hey-la-oh-la-oh-la-OH-la-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! I want to go with you, I want to go with you, With all of you at the same time To every place you’ve been! I want to meet head-on the same dangers you met, To feel on my face the winds that withered yours, To spit from my lips the salt of the seas that kissed yours, To help swab your decks, to be with you in storms, To arrive like you, ﬁnally, at extraordinary ports! To ﬂee with you from civilization! To lose with you all sense of morality! To feel my humanity change in faraway places. To drink with you in southern seas New savageries, new tumults in my soul, New central ﬁres in my volcanic spirit! To go with you, to take off (Get the hell out of here!) My civilized man’s suit, my mild-mannered ways, My congenital fear of chains and fetters, My peaceful life, My seated, static, orderly and repetitive life! To the sea, the sea, the sea, the sea! Ah, throw my life to the wind, to the waves, To the sea! Salt with windblown foam My taste for great voyages! Thrash with whipping water the ﬂesh of my adventure, Douse with the cold depths the bones of my existence, Scourge, cut and shrivel with winds, foams and suns My cyclonic, Atlantic being, My nerves stretched out like taut shrouds, A lyre in the hands of the winds! Yes, yes, yes ...C rucify me on your ocean crossings And my shoulders will revel in my cross! Tie me to your voyages as if to stakes, And the sensation of the stakes will enter through my spine And I’ll feel them in a vast, passive ecstasy! Do what you like with me, as long as it’s at sea, On ship decks, to the sound of waves. Wound me, rip me open, kill me! All I want is to take to Death A soul overﬂowing with Sea, Drunk silly on maritime things, On sailors as well as on anchors, ropes, On distant coasts as well as on the winds’ howling, On the Faraway as well as on the Wharf, on shipwrecks As well as on peaceful trade operations, On masts as well as on the waves, To take to Death—in voluptuous pain— A body covered with leeches sucking away, Covered with strange, absurd, green sea leeches! Make shrouds out of my veins! Hawsers out of my muscles! Flay my skin and nail it to the keels! And let me feel the pain of the nails and never stop feeling it! Make my heart into an admiral’s ﬂag On a ship of old in time of war! Yank out my eyes and grind them into the deck with your feet! Smash my bones against the gunwales! Tie me to the masts and thrash me, thrash me! To all the winds of all latitudes and longitudes Spill my blood over the r aging waters That sweep across the poop deck In the storms’ wild convulsions! To have the audacity of sailcloth in the wind! To be, like the topsails, the whistling of the winds! An old guitar playing a fado about seas rife with dangers, A song for sailors to hear and not repeat! The sailors who mutinied Hung the captain from a sail yard. Another they left on a desert isle, Marooned! The sun of the tropics has made my taut veins seethe With the fever of old-time piracy. The winds of Patagonia have tattooed my imagination With tragic and obscene images. Fire, ﬁre, ﬁre, inside me! Blood! blood! blood! blood! My brain is bursting! The world as I know it explodes in red! My veins snap with the sound of cables! And from deep within booms the savage and insatiable Song of the Great Pirate, The bellowing death of the Great Pirate, whose singing Sends a chill down the spine of his men. Astern he dies, howling his song: Fifteen men on a dead man’s chest, Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum! And then yells in a blasting, unreal voice: Darby M’Graw-aw-aw-aw-aw! Darby M’Graw-aw-aw-aw-aw-aw-aw-aw! Fetch a-a-aft the ru-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-um, Darby! Ah, what a life! what a life that was! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Hey-la-oh-la-oh-la-OH-la-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Split keels, sunken ships, blood on the seas! Decks awash in blood, sectioned corpses! Severed ﬁngers left lying on gunwales! Heads of children here and there! People with gouged eyes shouting, screaming! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! I bundle up in all this as in a cloak when it’s cold! I rub against all this like a cat in heat against a wall! I roar for all this like a famished lion! I rush at all this like a crazed bull! I dig my nails into this, break my claws on it and chew it till my teeth bleed! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Suddenly I hear the old cry, Now harsh, angry, metallic, Like a bugle blasting at my side, Calling the sighted prey, The schooner that’s going to be seized: Aho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o----yyyy... Schooner aho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o----yyyy... The World has ceased to exist for me! I’m burning red! I roar in fury for the attack! Pirate chief! Pirate Caesar! I plunder, kill, rip, slash! All I feel is the sea, the prey, the pillage! All I feel within are the veins of my temples Beating, and beating me! The sensation of my eyes is bleeding hot blood! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Ah pirates, pirates, pirates! Love me and hate me, pirates! Take me into your midst, pirates! How your rage and cruelty speak to the blood Of a woman’s body that once was mine and whose lust has survived! I’d love to be an animal that would embody all your acts, That would sink its teeth into the hulls and keels, That would eat masts, drink blood and tar on ship decks, Chew sails, oars, ropes and pulleys— A monstrous, female sea-serpent gorging on your crimes! And there’s a symphony of incompatible and analogous sensations, An orchestration in my blood of deafe ning crimes, Of convulsive clamors from bloody orgies on the high sea, All raging like a torrid gale through my mind, A cloud of hot dust obscuring my perception So that I see and dream all this with my skin and veins only! Pirates, piracy, vessels and the hour, The maritime hour when prey are captured And the terror of the captured escapes into madness— that hour With all its crimes, terror, vessels, people, sea, sky, clouds, Breezes, latitude, longitude, shouting voices, I’d like the Whole of this to be the Whole of my body, suffering, To be my body and my blood, to form the stuff of my being in red, To thrive like an itching wound in my soul’s unreal ﬂesh! Ah, to be everything in every crime! To be all the component parts Of raids on ships, of slaughters and rapes! To be whatever was on the spot where pillages occurred, To be whatever lived or was left dead on the site of gory tragedies! To be the sum-total-pirate of all piracy at its zenith, And the ﬂesh-and-blood synthesis of all pirate victims in the world! To be in my passive body the woman-all-women Ever raped, killed, cut and mauled by pirates! To be in my submissive self the female who needs to be theirs! And to feel all this—all these things all at once—running down my spine! O my hairy and gruff heroes of adventure and crime! My seafaring brutes, husbands of my imagination! Casual lovers of my oblique sensations! I long to be That Woman who waits for you in ports, For you, heinous men she loves in dreams with her pirate blood! For she would rage with you, though only in spirit, Over the naked corpses of your victims at sea! For she would be with you in your crimes, and in your oceanic orgy Her witch’s spirit would invisibly dance around each movement Of your bodies, your cutlasses, your strangling hands! On land she would wait for you, and when you came, if you came, In your love’s roaring she would drink all the vast, Foggy and sinister perfume of your conquests, And as you convulsed in ecstasy she would whistle a red and yellow sabbat! Flesh torn, bodies cut open and gutted, the blood sp urting! Now as my dream of your deeds reaches its climax, I lose myself completely, I stop belonging to you, I am you, My femininity is not just to be with you, it’s to be your very souls! To be inside all your brutality at the time you wreaked it, To imbibe deep down your consciousness of what you felt When you tinged the high sea with blood, When now and then you tossed to the sharks The still living bodies of the wounded and the pink ﬂesh of children, And you dragged their mothers to the deck rails to look at what happened to them! To be with you in your carnage and plundering! To be harmonized with you in the symphony of your pillages! Ah, how much and in how many ways I’d like to be yours! To be not only your woman, not only your women, not only your victims, Not only your victimized men, women, children and ships, To be not only that hour and the vessels and the waves, Not only your souls, your bodies, your rage, your property, To be not only the abstract orgy of your deeds in my physical self, Not only this, I’d like to be more than this—the God that’s all this! I’d have to be God, the God of an inverted faith, A monstrous and satanic God, the God of a blood-based pantheism, To be able to ﬁll up every cranny of my imaginative fury And never exhaust my desire to identify With the each and the all and the more-than-all of your conquests! Ah, torture me to cure me! Let my ﬂesh be the air your cutlasses slice Before they fall on heads and necks! Let my veins be the clothes your knives rip right through! My imagination the body of the women you rape! My mind the deck you stand on while killing! My entire life—in its nervous, hysterical, absurd ensemble— The great organism in which every act of piracy ever committed Would be a conscious cell, and all of me would spin As a huge, rocking putridity, embodying all of this! The feverish machine of my teeming visions Now spins at such frightening, inordinate speed That my ﬂywheel consciousness Is just a blurry circle whirring in the air. Fifteen men on a dead man’s chest, Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum! Hey-la-oh-la-oh-la-OH----l a-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah----ah-ah-ah... Ah! the savagery of this savagery! To hell With every life like ours, which has none of this! Look at me: an engineer! Necessarily practical, sensitive to everything, Static in comparison to you, even when I walk; Inert, even when I act; weak, even when I assert myself; Stagnant, shattered, a fainthearted renegade of your Glory, Of your shrill, hot and bloody dyna mic! Damn my inability to turn my delirium into action! Damn my always hanging on to civilization’s apron strings! Damn the dainty manners I carry on my back like a bale of lace! Errand boys of modern humanitarianism—that’s what we all are! A sorry lot of consumptives, neurasthenics, and phlegmatics, Without the courage to be violent and daring men, Our souls tied up like a chicken by the leg! Ah, pirates! pirates! The yearning for lawlessness coupled with brutality, The yearning for absolutely cruel and abominable things, Gnawing like an abstract lust at our delicate bodies, At our squeamish and effeminate nerves, And bringing mad fevers into our empty gazes! Make me kneel down before you! Beat and humiliate me! Make me your slave and your plaything! And don’t ever deprive me of your contempt! O my masters! O my lords! To always gloriously take the submissive part In bloody deeds and endless sensualities! Fall on me like massive walls, O barbarians of the ancient sea! Rip me and wound me! Streak my body with blood From east to west! Kiss with cutlasses, whips and rage My blissful carnal fear of belonging to you, My masochistic yearning to submit to your fury, To be the sentient, impassive object of your omnivorous cruelty, Rulers, lords, emperors, pirates! Ah, torture me, Rip me apart! And once I’ve been hacked into conscious pieces, Strew me over the decks, Scatter me across the waters, leave me On the voracious beaches of islands! Satiate in me all my mysticism of you! Engrave my soul in blood! Cut and slash! O tattooers of my bodily imagination! Beloved ﬂayers of my ﬂeshly submission! Subdue me like a dog that’s kicked to death! Make me the vessel of your lordly disdain! Make me all your victims! As Christ suffered for all men, I want to suffer For all who’ve been victims at your hands, Your callused and bloody han ds, with ﬁngers lopped off In sudden attacks at the gunwales! Make me into something that’s dragged —O pleasure, O beloved pain!— As if behind horses whipped by you... But all this at sea, at se-e-e-ea, at SE-E-E-E-EA! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! HEY-EY-EY-EY- EY-EY-EY! At S-E-E-E-EA! Yey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Yey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Yey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey- ey-ey! Everything shouts out! Every last thing shouts! Winds, waves, boats, Seas, topsails, pirates, my heart, blood, and the air, the air! Hey-ey-ey-ey! Yey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Yey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Everything shouts out in song! FIFTEEN MEN ON A DEAD MAN’S CHEST. YO-HO-HO AND A BOTTLE OF RUM! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Hey-ey-ey-ey- ey-ey-ey! Hey-la-oh-la-oh-la-OH-O-O-o-o-la-ah-ah-ah----ah-ah-ah! AHO-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O---yyy!... SCHOONER AHO-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O---- yyy!... Darby M’Graw-aw-aw-aw-aw-aw! DARBY M’GRAW-AW-AW-AW-AW-AW-AW! FETCH A-A-AFT THE RU-U-U-U-U-UM, DARBY! Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY! HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY! HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY! HEY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY-EY! Something in me snaps. The red has turned to dusk. I felt too much to be able to keep on feeling. My soul is spent, only an echo in me remains. The ﬂywheel is slowing down. My dreams lift their hands a bit from my eyes. There’s nothing in me but a void, a desert, a nocturnal sea. And as soon as I feel this nocturnal sea in me, Then again, yet again, from out of the silence Of its endless distance, the vast and age-old cry arises. Like a lightning ﬂash of sound—soothing, not noisy— Suddenly encompassing all the wet maritime Horizon and dark human surging in the night, Like the voice of a distant siren weeping, calling, it rises From the depths of the Far, the depths of the Sea, the heart of the Abyss, And on the surface, like seaweed, ﬂoat my broken dreams... Aho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o----y y... Schooner aho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o----y y... Ah, the freshness of dew on my exhilaration! The coolness of night on my inner ocean! Everything in me suddenly beholds a night at sea Full of the vast and utterly human mystery of the nocturnal waves. The moon rises on the horizon And my happy childhood wells up in me like a tear. My past resurfaces, as if that mariner’s cry Were a scent, a voice, the echo of a song Calling up from my past That happiness I’ll never again know. It was in the old peaceful house by the river... (My bedroom windows, like the dining room windows, Looked out over some low-lying houses and, just beyond them, the river, The Tagus, this very same Tagus but at a point further down. If today I gazed out the same windows, I wouldn’t gaze out the same windows. That time has passed like smoke from a steamer on the high sea...) An inexplicable feeling of tenderness, A tearful and heartfelt remorse, For all those victims— especially the children— I dreamed of hurting when I dreamed I was a pirate of old... A feeling of regret, since they were my victims; A soft and tender feeling, since they weren’t really. A confused emotion, bluish like a fogged window, Sings old songs in my poor grieving heart. Ah, how could I think or dream those things? How far I am from what I was a few minutes ago! What hysterical feelings—ﬁrst one thing, then the opposite! As the blond morning rises, funny how my ears hear only Things that concur with this emotion—the lapping of the waters, The river water’s gentle lapping against the wharf ..., The sailboat passing along the river’s far shore, The distant, Japanese-blue hills, The houses of Almada, And whatever’s soft and childlike in the early morning hours!... A seagull passes by And my tenderness increases. But all this time I wasn’t paying any attention. All those things I felt were only skin-deep, like a caress. All this time I never took my eyes off my distant dream, My house by the river, My childhood by the river, My bedroom windows looking out onto the river at night, And the peace of the moonlight scattered over the waters! My old aunt, who loved me because of the son she’d lost... My old aunt used to sing me to sleep (Even though I was already too old for this). The memory makes tears fall on my heart, cleansing it of life, And a light sea breeze wafts inside me. Sometimes she sang “The Good Ship Catrineta”: There goes the Catrineta Over the waves of the sea... And at other times it was “The Fair Princess,” with its wistful, Medieval melody . . . I recall this, and her poor old voice rises in me, Reminding me how little I’ve thought of her since then, and she loved me so much! How ungrateful I’ve been to her—and what have I done with my life? Yes, “The Fair Princess” . . . I’d close my eyes as she sang: The Fair Princess Sat in her garden... And I’d open my eyes just a sliver, see the window full of moonlight, And shut them again, and in all of this I was happy. The Fair Princess Sat in her garden Combing her hair With her golden comb . . . O my childhood days, a doll someone broke! If I could only go back in time, to that house and that affection, And remain there forever, forever a child and forever happy! But all of this is the Past, a lantern on an old street corner. To remember it makes me cold, and hungry for something unobtainable. To think of it makes me feel an absurd regret for I don’t know what. O slow whirlpool of conﬂicting sensations! Faint vertigo of confused things in my soul! Shattered furies, tender feelings like spools of thread children play with, Avalanches of imagination over the eyes of my senses, Tears, useless tears, Light breezes of contradiction grazing my soul... To shake off this emotion, I invoke with a conscious effort, I invoke with a desperate, worthless, arid effort The song of the Great Pirate as he was dying: Fifteen men on a dead man’s chest, Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum! But the song is a straight line drawn crookedly inside me... With a struggle I’m able, but through an almost literary imagination, To bring back into my soul’s ﬁeld of vision The rage of piracy, of slaughter, the almost mouth-watering appetite for pillage, For the frivolous slaughter of women and children, For the gratuitous torture of poorer passengers, merely to amuse ourselves, And the sensuality of breaking and shattering the things others most cherish, But I dream all this while dreading something breathing down my neck. I remember how interesting it would be To hang sons before their mothers’ eyes (But I can’t help but feel like the mothers), To bury alive four-year-old children on desert isles, Taking their parents there in boats to see (But I shudder, remembering the son I don’t have who’s quietly sleeping at home). I try to stir a dead yearning for sea crimes, For an inquisition without the excuse of Faith, Crimes without even any wrath or malice behind them, Carried out mechanically, not to hurt, not to harm And not even to amuse ourselves, but just to pass the time, Like country people who play solitaire at the dining table after dinner, with the tablecloth pushed to one side, Just for the soothing pleasure of committing heinous crimes and thinking nothing of it, Of watching suffering victims reach the brink of madness and death-from-pain without letting them cross it... But my imagination refuses to go along. A shiver runs through me. And suddenly, more suddenly than before, from farther away and deeper down, Suddenly—oh the terror coursing through my veins! Oh the sudden cold from the door to Mystery which opened in me and let in a draft!— I remember God, the Transcendent in life, and suddenly The old voice of the English sailor Jim Barnes, whom I used to talk with, Becomes in me the voice of my mysterious affection for silly things like a mother’s lap and a sister’s hair ribbon, A voice arriving miraculously from beyond the appearance of things, The faint and remote Voice that’s now the Absolute Voice, the Mouthless Voice, Arriving from above and from within the seas’ nocturnal solitude, Calling me, calling me, calling me... It comes faintly, as if mufﬂed but still audible, From far away, as if it sounded elsewhere and couldn’t be heard here, Like a stiﬂed sob, a snuffed ﬂame, a silent breath, From no corner in space, from no place in time, The eternal cry of night, the deep and confused murmur: Aho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o- - - yyy . . . . . . Aho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o----yyy . . . . . . . . . Schooner aho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-----yy . . . . . . A cold chill from the soul makes my whole body shiver, And I suddenly open my eyes, which I hadn’t closed. Ah, how good to emerge once and for all from my dreams! To return to the real world, so easy on the nerves! The world on this early morning when the day’s ﬁrst steamers are arriving... I’m no longer interested in the incoming steamer from before. It’s still far away. Only what’s close now cleanses my soul. My healthy, rugged, pragmatic imagination Is concerned now only with useful, modern things, With freighters, steamers and passengers, With rugged, immediate, modern, commercial, real things. The ﬂywheel in me is slowing down. Wonderful modern maritime life— Clean, ﬁt, and full of machines! All so well ordered, so spontaneously organized, All the machine parts, all oceangoing vessels, All aspects of import and export trade activity So perfectly integrated That everything seems to happen by natural laws, Nothing ever colliding with anything else! Nothing has lost its poetry. And now there are also machines With their poetry, and this entirely new kind of life, This commercial, worldly, intellectual and sentimental life Which the machine age has conferred on our souls. Voyages are as lovely as they ever were, And a ship will always be lovely, just because it is a ship. Travel is still travel, and the faraway is where it has always been: Nowhere at all, thank God! The ports full of every kind of steamer! Large and small, of various colors, their portholes variously arranged, And belonging to so wonderfully many shipping lines! Steamers in port, so individual in their separate berths! So attractive in their stately calm of commercial things that ply the sea, The ancient and forever Homeric sea, O Ulysses! The humanitarian glance of lighthouses far off in the night! Or the sudden ﬂashing of a nearby lighthouse on a dark dark night (“How close we were to the coast!” And the sound of the water sings in our ear!)... All this is as it always was, but today there’s commerce, And the commercial destiny of the great steamers Makes me proud of my era! The variety of people aboard passenger ships Fills me with the modern pride of living at a time when it’s so easy For races to mix together and distances to be crossed, so easy to see everything And enjoy life, making a good number of dreams come true. Neat, orderly and modern like an ofﬁce with service windows made of latticed yellow wire, My present feelings—natural and discreet like gentlemen— Are practical and free of hysteria, ﬁlling their lungs with ocean air Like people perfectly aware of how healthy it is to breathe air from the sea. The day is now deﬁnitely geared for working, Everything begins to move, to get organized. With great immediate and natural pleasure I follow with my soul All the commercial operations needed for a shipment of goods. My era is the rubber stamp appearing on all invoices, And I feel that all letters from all ofﬁces Should be addressed to me. A bill of lading is so distinctive, And a ship captain’s signature so handsome and modern! The commercial formality at the beginning and end of letters: Dear Sirs—Messieurs —Amigos e Senhores, Yours faithfully—Nos salutations empressées... All of this isn’t only human and tidy but also beautiful, And it ultimately has a maritime destiny: a steamer on which are loaded The goods named in the letters and invoices. Life’s complexity! Though drawn up by people Who love, hate, have political passions and sometimes commit crimes, The invoices are so neat, so well written, so independent of all that! Some people look at an invoice and don’t feel this. Surely you felt it, Cesário Verde. And I feel it so humanly it makes me cry. Don’t try to tell me there’s no poetry in business and in ofﬁces! It enters through every pore ...I breathe it in this ocean air, Because all of this concerns steamers and modern navigation, Because invoices and business letters are the beginning of the story, And the ships carrying the goods across the eternal sea are the end. Ah, and the voyages—holiday voyages and other kinds... Voyages on the sea, where we’re all companions In a special way, as if a maritime mystery Brought our souls together and transformed us for a moment Into transient citizens of the same uncertain country, Eternally moving over the vastness of the waters! Grand hotels of the Inﬁnite, O my transatlantic ships! Totally and perfectly cosmopolitan, for you never stay long in one place, And you contain every sort of face, costume and race! Voyages, voyagers—so many different kinds! So many nationalities, professions and people in the world! So many different directions one can take in life, In this life which at heart is always, always the same life! So many curious faces! All faces are curious, And nothing makes for holiness like constantly looking at people. Brotherhood is not after all a revolutionary idea. It’s something we learn in daily life, where everything has to be tolerated. And we begin to appreciate what we have to tolerate, Until we nearly weep with affection for what we once tolerated! Ah, all this is beautiful, all this is human and linked To human feelings, so sociable and bourgeois, So complexly simple, so metaphysically sad! The diversiﬁed, ﬂoating life ends up educating us in humanity. Poor humans! Poor humans all of us! I take leave of this moment in the person of this other ship Which is now setting sail. It’s an English tramp steamer, Quite grungy, as if it were a French ship, With the friendly air of a seaborne proletarian, And no doubt mentioned on the back page of yesterday’s papers. My heart goes out to the poor steamer, so humble and unaffected. It seems to feel responsible for something, to be an honest person, Faithful to some duty or other. There it goes, leaving its berth in front of where I’m sitting on the wharf. There it goes, placidly passing where sailing ships once passed, Long, long ago... To Cardiff? Liverpool? London? It doesn’t matter. It does its duty. As we should do ours. Marvelous life! Bon voyage! Bon voyage! Bon voyage, my poor chance friend who did me the favor Of taking with you the sadness and delirium of my dreams, Restoring me to life so I can watch you and see you sail aw a y. Bon voyage! Bon voyage! That’s what life is... With what natural elegance so typical of morning You sail tall and straight from out of Lisbon’s harbor today! I feel strangely endeared and grateful to you for this... For this what? Who knows what!...Go on...Sail away... With a slight quiver (Tch-tch--tch---tch----tch-----tch ...) The ﬂywheel in me comes to a halt. Sail away, slow steamer, sail and don’t stay... Sail away from me, sail out of my sight, Depart from inside my heart, Disappear into the Faraway, the Faraway, the mist of God, Disappear, follow your destiny and leave me... Who am I to weep for you and question you? Who am I to speak to you and love you? Who am I to be troubled by the sight of you? It pushes off from the wharf, the sun rises golden, shines brighter, Glancing off the rooftops of the buildings on the wharf. The whole of this side of the city is gleaming... Depart, leave me, become First the ship in mid-river, separate and distinct, Then a small, black ship headed toward the bar, Then a hazy point on the horizon (O anxiety!), An ever hazier point on the horizon... Then nothing, just me and my sadness, And the great city now bathed in sunlight, And the real, naked hour like a wharf without ships, And the slow turning of the crane, like a turning compass, Tracing a semicircle of I don’t know what emotion In the staggered silence of my soul...

4,poem_5,SALUTATION TO WALT WHITMAN Portugal Inﬁnity eleventh nineteen hundred and ﬁfteen Hey la a a a a a a From here in Portugal with every historical age in my brain I salute you Walt I salute you my Universal brother Forever modern and eternal the singer of concrete absolutes Passionate mistress of the scattered universe Great homosexual who rubs against the diversity of things Sexualized by stones by trees by people by professions Full of lust for passing bodies chance encounters mere observations Champion of the material substance of all things My glorious hero who goes into Death skipping Greeting God with shouts and roars and squeals Singer of ﬁerce and tender brotherhood with all things Great democrat in all your pores close in body and soul to everything Carnival of all actions bacchanalia of all intentions Twin brother of all initiatives Jean Jacques Rousseau of the world bound to produce machines Homer of the elusive carnal ﬂux Shakespeare of sensations that were beginning to run on steam Milton Shelley of Electricity on the horizon Incubus of all gestures Inner spasm of all outer objects Pimp of the whole Universe Slut of all solar systems pansy of God I with my monocle and exaggeratedly tight waisted coat Am not unworthy of you Walt and you know it I m not unworthy of you for the simple reason that I salute you I so prone to inertia and so easily bored Am one of yours you know I am and I love and understand you And although I never met you being born around the year you died I know you loved me too you knew me and it gladdens my heart I know that you

for all To leave the world like a man who realizes he s bankrupt Like a traveling salesman who sells ships to people from the interior To the junk heap with broken motors What was my entire being An enormous useless yearning A sterile pursuit of an impossible goal A madman s machine to achieve perpetual motion An absurd theorem to prove that a circle is square An attempt to swim across the

time Let s leave Come on The road is waiting for us To leave is to have already gone Let s leave for where everything stays put O road to no more roads The last stop of No Stopping In my poems I sing of trains I sing of cars I sing of steamers But however high I hoist my poem it has only rhythms and ideas It has no steel iron or wheels it has no wood no ropes It lacks the reality of a road s most negligible stone The stone people step on without ever looking at it But which may be looked at picked up stepped on Whereas my poems are like ideas that may or may not be understood What I want is iron not just to sing of iron What I think gives only the idea of steel not the steel What infuriates me in all my mind s emotions Is that I can t swap my rhythm that mimics rippling water For the real coolness of water on my hands For the visible sound of the river where I can enter and get wet Which can make my suit drip Where I can drown myself if I like And which has the natural divinity of being there without literature Shit A thousand times shit for everything I can t do But what Walt can you hear me is everything everything everything Damn the bad luck of our not being God Such that our ﬂesh could write poems in Universes and Realities And our ideas be things our thoughts Inﬁnity And I d have real stars in my thinking being Number names in every corner of my emotion Earth The true modern poem is life without poems It s the train itself and not verses that sing of it It s the iron of the rails the hot rails the iron of the wheels their actual spin And not my poems that talk about rails and wheels they don t have The wind up or string pulled train of a child Has more real motion than our poems Our poems that don t have wheels Our poems that go nowhere Our unread poems

burning with all Europe in my brain In my explosive brain with no dikes to contain it In my dynamic master intelligence In my trademark projector bank check rubber stamp sensuality Why the devil do we

far away I stop I listen I recognize myself The sound of my voice in the air has fallen lifeless I m the same as I was you are dead and everything is still Saluting you was a way of trying to inject life into myself And so I saluted you in spite of feeling that I lack The vital energy to salute anyone O heart that won t heal Who will save me from you,"SALUTATION TO WALT WHITMAN Portugal, Inﬁnity— eleventh, nineteen hundred and ﬁfteen... Hey-la-a-a-a-a-a-a! From here in Portugal, with every historical age in my brain, I salute you, Walt, I salute you, my Universal brother, Forever modern and eternal, the singer of concrete absolutes, Passionate mistress of the scattered universe, Great homosexual who rubs against the diversity of things, Sexualized by stones, by trees, by people, by professions, Full of lust for passing bodies, chance encounters, mere observations, Champion of the material substance of all things, My glorious hero who goes into Death skipping, Greeting God with shouts and roars and squeals! Singer of ﬁerce and tender brotherhood with all things, Great democrat in all your pores, close in body and soul to everything, Carnival of all actions, bacchanalia of all intentions, Twin brother of all initiatives, Jean-Jacques Rousseau of the world bound to produce machines, Homer of the elusive carnal ﬂux, Shakespeare of sensations that were beginning to run on steam, Milton-Shelley of Electricity on the horizon! Incubus of all gestures, Inner spasm of all outer objects, Pimp of the whole Universe, Slut of all solar systems, pansy of God! I, with my monocle and exaggeratedly tight-waisted coat, Am not unworthy of you, Walt, and you know it. I’m not unworthy of you, for the simple reason that I salute you... I, so prone to inertia and so easily bored, Am one of yours, you know I am, and I love and understand you, And although I never met you, being born around the year you died, I know you loved me too, you knew me, and it gladdens my heart. I know that you knew me, considered me and explained me, And I know that that’s what I am, whether on the Brooklyn Ferry ten years before I was born Or on the Rua do Ouro today, thinking about everything that’s not the Rua do Ouro, And as you felt everything, I feel everything, we walk hand in hand, Hand in hand, Walt, hand in hand, dancing the universe in our soul. I kiss your picture all the time. Wherever you are now (I don’t know where, but I know it’s God) You feel this, I know you feel it, and my kisses (in person) are warmer, Which is how you want them, and so you thank me from where you are, I’m sure of it, something tells me so—a satisﬁed feeling in my spirit, An indirect, abstract erection in the depths of my soul. You were cyclopean and muscular, not pretty, Yet your attitude toward the world was feminine, And for you each leaf of grass, each stone and each man was the Universe. Here’s to you, dear old Walt, my great Comrade, evoe! I belong to your Bacchic orgy of unbridled sensations, I’m one of yours—from the feeling in my feet to the nausea in my dreams. I’m one of yours, look at me. From where you are, in God, you see me in reverse, From inside out...You d ivine my body; what you see is my soul, Seeing it directly, and through its eyes my body. Look at me: you know that I, Álvaro de Campos, engineer, Sensationist poet, Am not your disciple, not your lover, and not your singer. You know I’m You and are glad for it! I can never read much of your poetry at once ...It’s too full of feeling... I move through your verses as through a jostling crowd, And they smell to me of sweat, of various oils, of human and mechanical activity, So that I ﬁnally don’t know if I’m reading or living, I don’t know if my true place is in the world or in your poetry, I don’t know if I’m here, with both feet on the natural earth, Or if I’m hanging upside down in some sort of emporium, Dangling from the natural ceiling of your tumultuous inspiration, From the middle of the ceiling of your unattainable intensity. Open all the doors! I’m coming through! My password? Walt Whitman! But to hell with a password... I’ll just come on through... I’ll break down the doors if I have to... Yes, I who am meek and civilized will break down the doors, Because in this moment I’m not meek or civilized, I’m ME, a thinking universe of ﬂesh and blood that wants to get through And that will get through, for when I want to get through, I’m God! Get this rubbish out of my sight! Stash these emotions into drawers! Away with politicians, literati, Smug businessmen, policemen, prostitutes, pimps! All of this is the letter that kills, not the spirit that gives life. The spirit that gives life in this moment is ME! Let no son of a bitch cross my path! My path is through inﬁnity all the way to the end! Whether or not I can reach the end is none of your business, let me go, It concerns only me, and God, and the meaning-that’s-me of the word Inﬁnite... For ward ! I dig in the spurs! And I feel the spurs, I’m the selfsame horse I ride, Because I, through my will to be one with God, Can be everything, or nothing, or anything, Depending on my mood...It’s no one else’s business... Raging delirium! I want to yelp, to leap, To rant, rave, jump, twirl and shout with my body, To cling to car wheels and get rolled over, To lie beneath the twisting of the whip that’s going to crack . . . . . To be the she-dog of all he-dogs and still not be satisﬁed, To be the ﬂywheel of all machines and never go fast enough, To be whatever’s crushed, abandoned, uprooted, destroyed, And all for you, to sing and salute you . . . . . Dance with me this delirium, Walt, in the world where you are now, Hop with me in this tribal dance that bumps into the stars, Fall with me to the ground from exhaustion, Dash with me into the walls until we’re dazed, Shatter with me into smithereens . . . . . In all, through all, around all, without all, An abstract bodily rage stirring maelstroms in the soul... Come on! Forward! Even if God tries to stop us, let’s go forward...It d oesn’t matter... Let’s go forward, Forward, to no place at all... Inﬁnity! The Universe! Goal with no goal! What does it matter? Boom! boom! boom! boom! boom! Right now, yes, let’s go, straight ahead, boom! Boom! Boom! Hup-hup . . . hup-hup . . . hup-hup . . . hup-hup... Like a hurled thunderbolt I rush Toward you in leaps of the heart. With military bands leading the way, I keep saluting you... In a grand procession with frenzied shouting and jumping I scream out your name at the top of my lungs, And every cheer for me and for you and for God I give to you, And the universe spins around us like a carousel with music inside our heads, And I, with intrinsic lights in my anterior epidermis, Mad from the drunken, musical hissing of machines, And you, the renowned, the reckless, you ( ...) ◆ And so it’s to you I address My verses that are leaps, my verses that are jumps, my spasm verses, My hysterical-attack verses, My verses that pull the carriage of my nerves. Tripping and stumbling I get inspired, I’m so excited I can hardly breathe or stand still, And my verses are my not being able to burst from living. Throw open all the windows! Rip all the doors off their hinges! Pull the house down on top of me! I want to live at large in the open air, I want to have gestures outside my body, I want to run like rain down the walls, I want to be stepped on like the paving stones of roadways, I want to sink like a dead weight to the bottom of the sea, With a sensuality I lost ages ago! I don’t want latches on the doors! I don’t want locks on coffers! I want to mix in, to merge, to be swept along, I want to become someone else’s aching possession, To be dumped out of garbage cans, To be tossed into the sea, To be sought out at home for obscene purposes— Anything but to keep on sitting here quietly! Anything but to keep on writing these verses! I want a world without gaps! I want objects to materially touch each other and interpenetrate! I want physical bodies to belong to each other like souls, Not just dynamically but statically too! I want to ﬂy and to fall from high up! To be hurled like a grenade! To end up in X, to be taken to Y... Abstract apogee at the end of me and of everything! Motorized iron climax! Stairless staircase of speed climbing higher! Hydraulic pump extracting my throbbing guts like an anchor! Put me in shackles just so that I can break them! So that I can break them with my teeth and make my teeth bleed! O masochistic, blood-spurting joy of life! The sailors took me prisoner. Their hands squeezed me in the darkness, And I died for a moment when I felt this. Then my soul licked the ﬂoor of my private jail To the shrill buzzing of impossibilities surrounding my ire. Leap, jump, bite down on the bit, Red-hot Pegasus of my restless yearnings, Uncertain end of my motorized destiny! Jump, leap, drape yourself with ﬂags, Mark the nocturnal vastness with your trail in blood, In hot blood stretching far behind you, In fresh blood stretching far behind you, In cold, living blood through the air I dynamically feel! Jump, hurdle, leap, Alley-oop, keep jumping . . . . . ◆ My cavalcade-prayer! My forward charge-salutation! Who besides you felt the individual life in each thing? Who besides you felt himself, and life and us to exhaustion? Who besides you always preferred the spare part to the regular one And made it his norm to violate Life’s norms and forms? . . . . . My happiness is a rage, My forward charge a collision (Bam!) In me... In you, O Master of my healthful disease, I salute the ﬁrst classic case of universalitis, The “Whitman syndrome,” which is what afﬂicts me! St. Walt of Shrieking Deliriums and Rage! ◆ Gateway to everything! Bridge to everything! Road to everything! Your omnivorous soul . . . . . Your soul that’s bird, ﬁsh, beast, man, woman, Your soul the two where there are two, Your soul the one that’s two where two are one. Your soul that’s arrow, lightning, space, Embrace, nexus, sex, Texas, Carolina, New York, Brooklyn Ferry in the evening, Brooklyn Ferry coming and going, Libertad! Democracy! The twentieth century up ahead! Boom! boom! boom! boom! boom! BOOM! You, what you were, what you saw, what you heard, Subject and object, active and passive, Here and there, everywhere you, A circle encompassing all ways of feeling, Milestone of all things possible, God-Boundary of all objects imaginable—that’s you! You the Hour, You the Minute, You the Second! You interspersed, liberated, unfurled, departed, Interspersion, liberation, departure, unfurlment, Intersperser, liberator, unfurler, sender, Postmark on all letters, Name in all addresses, Merchandise delivered, returned, in transit... Train of sensations moving at soul-miles per hour, Per hour, per minute, per second. BOOM! And all these natural, human and machine noises Go together, a sum tumult of everything, Full of me to you, saluting you— Human shouts and earthly cries, Echoes from hills, The burbling of waters, The loud blasts of war, The weeping clamor of suffering peoples, The mufﬂed sounds of sighs in the darkness. And closer to life, surrounding me (And it’s my ﬁnest prize for saluting you), There are the whistles, chugging and screeching of trains, The modern noises, factory noises, Steady hum, Motor wheels, Flywheels, Propellers Boom... ◆ In a great all-cities-of-Europe marche aux ﬂambeaux , In a great war march of industry, commerce and leisure, In a great race, in a great rise, in a great fall, Howling, jumping, and everything jumping with me, I leap up and salute you, I salute you with loud shouts, I salute you with a burst of somersaults, handstands and hoorays! Hey-la! (...) ◆ Hey-la, I’m going to summon All the human swarming of the Universe, All varieties of all emotions, All types of all thoughts, All wheels, all gears and all pistons of the soul To the blaring, deafening privilege of saluting you. Hup-hup! I shout, And in a procession of Me to you they all rumble In a metaphysical and real gibberish, In an uproar of things clashing within me . . . . . Ave, hail, hurrah, O great bastard of Apollo, Passionate, impotent lover of the nine Muses and three Graces, Funicular from Olympus to us and from us to Olympus, Rage of the modern materialized in me, Transparent spasm of being, Flower of other people’s actions, Joyous feasting because there’s Life, Mad fury because no one has enough life to be all men, Since being means being a bastard, and only God could satisfy us. Ah, you sang everything and yet left everything unsung. Who in his body can throb harder than his body throbs? Who can feel more feelings than there are to feel? Who can be sufﬁcient when nothing sufﬁces? Who can be complete as long as one blade of grass Has its root outside his heart? ◆ Open all the doors! Break all the windows! Remove the locks from this enclosing life! Remove this enclosing life from this enclosing life! Let closing be openness, with no locks as reminders, Let “stopping” be the ignorant term for continuing, Let the end be an always abstract thing, Fluidly connected to every end ever reached. I want to breathe! Strip my body of all its weight! Replace my soul with abstract wings attached to nothing! No, not wings, just the enormous Wing of Flight itself! No, not even Flight, just the speed that remains when ceasing becomes ﬂying And there’s no body to weigh down the soul of Going! I want to be the heat of living things, the fever Of saps, the rhythm of waves and the . . . . . Gap in Being that allows Being to be...! No boundaries anywhere! No divisions in anything! Just Me. ◆ Where I’m not the ﬁrst, I prefer to be nothing, to not be there. Where I can’t be the ﬁrst to act, I prefer to watch others act. Where I can’t rule, I refuse even to obey. I ardently yearn for everything, so ardently that I never miss ou t , And I don’t miss out because I don’t try. “All or nothing” has a special relevance for me. But I can’t be universal, because I’m individual. I can’t be all men, because I’m One, just one, just me. I can’t be ﬁrst in anything, because there is no ﬁrst. And so I prefer the nothing of being nothing but that nothing. When does the last train leave, Walt? I want to leave this city known as Earth, I want to emigrate from the country of Me once and for all, To leave the world like a man who realizes he’s bankrupt, Like a traveling salesman who sells ships to people from the interior. To the junk heap with broken motors! What was my entire being? An enormous, useless yearning, A sterile pursuit of an impossible goal, A madman’s machine to achieve perpetual motion, An absurd theorem to prove that a circle is square, An attempt to swim across the Atlantic that failed Before I ever entered the water, just by looking at it and calculating, A hail of stones at the moon, An absurd desire for the two parallels of God and life to meet. My nerves’ megalomania, My rigid body’s yearning for elasticity, My physical self ’s rage because it’s not the sovereign axis, The sensual vehicle of abstract enthusiasm, The world’s dynamic void! Let’s leave Being behind us. Let’s leave for good this small town called Life, This suburb-World of God, And let’s venture into the city headlong, Without stopping, just madly Going... Let’s go away once and for all. When does the last train leave for where you are, Walt? What God was I that my nostalgia should arouse such yearnings? Perhaps by departing I’ll return. Perhaps by ending I’ll arrive— Who knows? Any time is the right time. Let’s leave, Come on! The road is waiting for us. To leave is to have already gone. Let’s leave for where everything stays put. O road to no-more-roads! The last stop of No-Stopping! ◆ In my poems I sing of trains, I sing of cars, I sing of steamers, But however high I hoist my poem, it has only rhythms and ideas, It has no steel, iron or wheels, it has no wood, no ropes, It lacks the reality of a road’s most negligible stone, The stone people step on without ever looking at it But which may be looked at, picked up, stepped on. Whereas my poems are like ideas that may or may not be understood. What I want is iron, not just to sing of iron. What I think gives only the idea of steel, not the steel. What infuriates me in all my mind’s emotions Is that I can’t swap my rhythm that mimics rippling water For the real coolness of water on my hands, For the visible sound of the river where I can enter and get wet, Which can make my suit drip, Where I can drown myself, if I like, And which has the natural divinity of being there without literature. Shit! A thousand times shit for everything I can’t do. But what, Walt (can you hear me?), is everything, everything, everything? Damn the bad luck of our not being God Such that our ﬂesh could write poems in Universes and Realities, And our ideas be things, our thoughts Inﬁnity! And I’d have real stars in my thinking-being, Number-names in every corner of my emotion-Earth. ◆ The true modern poem is life without poems, It’s the train itself and not verses that sing of it, It’s the iron of the rails, the hot rails, the iron of the wheels, their actual spin, And not my poems that talk about rails and wheels they don’t have. ◆ The wind-up or string-pulled train of a child Has more real motion than our poems... Our poems that don’t have wheels, Our poems that go nowhere, Our unread poems that never leave the page. (I’m sick of life, sick of art, Sick of not having things, either out of lack or out of fear— My breathing like a practical joke to torment me, My self-image like a ridiculous carnival puppet. When does the last train leave?) I know that the way I sing of you isn’t by singing of you, but so what? I know it’s by singing of everything, but to sing of everything is to sing of you. I know it’s by singing of me, but to sing of me is to sing of you. I know that even to say I can’t sing is to sing of you, Walt... ◆ To sing of you, To salute you, I’d have to write the supreme poem Which, more than any other supreme poem, would embrace In a total synthesis (based on an exhaustive analysis) The whole Universe of things, living beings and souls, The whole Universe of men, women and children, The whole Universe of acts, gestures, feelings, thoughts, The whole Universe of the things mankind makes And the things mankind experiences— Professions, laws, norms, medical sciences, Fate, Written this way and that, constantly crisscrossing On the dynamic paper of Events, On the quick papyrus of social groupings, On the palimpsest of continuously renewed emotions. ◆ For me to salute you, To salute you as you should be saluted, I need to make my verses into a steed, Make my verses into a train, Make my verses into an arrow, Make my verses sheer speed, Make my verses the things of the world. You sang everything, and in you everything sang— Magniﬁcent whorish receptivity Of your sensations with their legs wide open To the outlines and details of the whole universe. ◆ Hup-hup what, or why, or to where? Hup-hup to what end? Hup-hup to where, make-believe steed? Hup-hup to where, imaginary train? Hup-hup to where, O arrow, haste and speed Which are all just me pining after you, All just me feeling your absence in every last nerve? Hup-hup to where, if there is no where or how? Hup-hup to where, if I’m always where I am and never up ahead, Never ahead and never behind But always irremediably in the place of my body, All too humanly in the thinking center of my soul, Always the same indivisible atom of the divine personality? Hup-hup to where, O sadness of not achieving what I want? Hup-hup to where and for what? Hup-hup what or without what? Hup-hup-hup, but where to, O my uncertainty? If only I could stop writing verse on verse on verse about iron And see, have and be iron instead, and have that be my poetry, Poetry-iron-poetry, psycho-physio-I circle! (When does the last train leave?) ◆ Time for our vitality to declare bankruptcy! We write poetry, singing of the things we don’t live: our bankruptcies. If only there were a way to live all lives and all ages And all forms of form And all gestures of gestures! What’s the writing of poetry but a confession that life isn’t enough? What’s art but a way to forget that life is just this? Farewell, Walt, farewell! Farewell until the indeﬁnite that lies beyond the End. Wait for me, if where you are you can wait. When does the last train leave? When do we leave? ◆ Hup-hup? Hup what and hup why? What do I get from hup-hup or from anything Prompting me to think of hup-hup? Decadents, old boy, that’s what we are... Deep down in each of us there’s a Byzantium in ﬂames, And although I don’t feel the ﬂames and don’t feel Byzantium, The Empire is dying out in our watery veins, And Poetry was but our incapacity to act... You, singer of vigorous professions, You the Poet of the Strong and the Extreme, You, inspiration’s muscle, ruled by male muses, You, ﬁnally, an innocent in a state of hysteria, Finally just a “caresser of life,” A shiftless idler, a pansy at least in spirit. That was your business, nobody else’s, but where’s Life in all that? I, an engineer by profession, sick of everything and everyone, I, absolutely superﬂuous, at war with things, I, useless, worn-out, unproductive, pretentious and amoral, Buoy of my sensations scattered by the storm, Anchor in the depths that broke off from my ship, I—can you believe it?—a singer of Life and Power, I, healthy and vigorous like you in my poems, And even sincere like you, burning with all Europe in my brain, In my explosive brain with no dikes to contain it, In my dynamic master intelligence, In my trademark, projector, bank-check, rubber-stamp sensuality. Why the devil do we live, and write verses? Damn the sloth that makes us poets, The degeneracy that fools us into thinking we’re artists, The fundamental tedium that tries to pass us off as energetic and modern When all we really want is to amuse ourselves, to savor an idea of life, Since we do nothing and are nothing, life limply ﬂowing through our veins. Let’s at least see things as they really are, Walt... Let’s swallow all this like a bitter pill And agree to send life and the world to hell Because we’re tired of looking at it, not because we abhor or disdain it. Is this any way to salute you? Whatever it is, it’s to salute you. Whatever it’s worth, it’s to love you. Whatever it comes to, it’s to agree with you. Whatever it is, it’s this. And you understand, you like it. You, old boy, crying on my shoulder, agree with me... (When does the last train leave? A long holiday spent in God... Let’s go without fear, let’s go ...) All this must have another meaning Beyond just living and having all we have... There must be a point of consciousness In which the landscape is transformed And begins to interest us, assist us, arouse us, In which a cool breeze stirs in our soul And sunny ﬁelds open up in our recently awakened senses... We’ll meet at the Station, wherever it is... Wait for me at the entrance, Walt; I’ll be there... I’ll be there without the universe, without life, without myself, without anything... And we’ll remember, all by ourselves, in silence and with our sorrow, The world’s tremendous absurdity, the bitter inadequacy of things, And I’ll feel the great mystery, I’ll feel it far away, so far aw a y, So abstractly and absolutely far away, Deﬁnitively far away. ◆ I stop, I listen, I recognize myself! The sound of my voice in the air has fallen, lifeless. I’m the same as I was, you are dead, and everything is still... Saluting you was a way of trying to inject life into myself, And so I saluted you in spite of feeling that I lack The vital energy to salute anyone! O heart that won’t heal! Who will save me from you?

I want ﬁfty things at the same time. I long with meat-craving anxiety For I don’t know what— Deﬁnitely something indeﬁnit e... I sleep ﬁtfully and live in the ﬁtful dream-state Of a ﬁtful sleeper, half dreaming. All abstract and necessary doors were closed in my face. Curtains were drawn across every hypothesis I could have seen from the street. I found the alley but not the number of the address I was given. I woke up to the same life I’d fallen asleep to. Even the armies I dreamed of were defeated. Even my dreams felt false while I dreamed them. Even the life I merely long for jades me— even that life... At intermittent intervals I understand; I write in respites from my weariness; And a boredom bored even of itself casts me ashore. I don’t know what destiny or future belongs to my anxiety adrift on the waves; I don’t know what impossible South Sea islands await me, a castaway, Or what palm groves of literature will grant me at least a verse. No, I don’t know this, or that, or anything else... And in the depths of my spirit, where I dream all I’ve dreamed, In my soul’s far-ﬂung ﬁelds, where I remember for no reason (And the past is a natural fog of false tears), On the roads and pathways of distant forests Where I supposed my being dwelled— There my dreamed armies, defeated without having been, And my nonexistent legions, annihilated in God, All ﬂee in disarray, the last remnants Of the ﬁnal illusion. Once more I see you, City of my horrifyingly lost childhood... Happy and sad city, once more I dream here... I? Is it one and the same I who lived here, and came back, And came back again, and again, And yet again have come back? Or are we—all the I’s that I was here or that were here— A series of bead-beings joined together by a string of memory, A series of dreams about me dreamed by someone outside me? Once more I see you, With a heart that’s more distant, a soul that’s less mine. Once more I see you—Lisbon, the Tagus and the rest— A useless onlooker of you and of myself, A foreigner here like everywhere else, Incidental in life as in my soul, A ghost wandering through halls of remembrances To the sound of rats and creaking ﬂoorboards In the accursed castle of having to live... Once more I see you, A shadow moving among shadows, gleaming For an instant in some bleak unknown light Before passing into the night like a ship’s wake swallowed In water whose sound fades into silence... Once more I see you, But, oh, I cannot see myself! The magic mirror where I always looked the same has shattered, And in each fateful fragment I see only a piece of me— A piece of you and of me!

Now’s your chance! I, who greatly love both death and life, Would kill myself too, if I dared kill myself... If you dare, then be daring! What good to you is the changing picture of outer images We call the world? What good is this cinema of hours played out By actors with stock roles and gestures, This colorful circus of our never-ending drive to keep going? What good is your inner world which you don’t know? Kill yourself, and maybe you’ll ﬁnally know it... End it all, and maybe you’ll begin... If you’re weary of existing, at least Be noble in your weariness, And don’t, like me, sing of life because you’re drunk, Don’t, like me, salute death through literature! You’re needed? O futile shadow called man! No one is needed; you’re not needed by anyone... Without you everything will keep going without you. Perhaps it’s worse for others that you live than if you kill yourself... Perhaps your presence is more burdensome than your absence... Other people’s grief? You’re worried About them crying over you? Don’t worry: they won’t cry for long... The impulse to live gradually stanches tears When they’re not for our own sake, When they’re because of what happened to someone else, especially death, Since after this happens to someone, nothing else will... First there’s anxiety, the surprise of mystery’s arrival And of your spoken life’s sudden absence... Then there’s the horror of your visible and material cofﬁn, And the men in black whose profession is to be there. Then the attending family, heartbroken and telling jokes, Mourning between the latest news from the evening papers, Mingling grief over your death with the latest crime... And you merely the incidental cause of that lamentation, You who will be truly dead, much deader than you imagine... Much deader down here than you imagine, Even if in the beyond you may be much more alive... Next comes the black procession to the vault or grave, And ﬁnally the beginning of the death of your memory. At ﬁrst everyone feels relieved That the slightly irksome tragedy of your death is over... Then, with each passing day, the conversation lightens up And life falls back into its old routine... Then you are slowly forgotten. You’re remembered only twice a year: On you birthday and your death day. That’s it. That’s all. That’s absolutely all. Two times a year they think about you. Two times a year those who loved you heave a sigh, And they may sigh on the rare occasions someone mentions your name. Look at yourself in the face and honestly face what we are... If you want to kill yourself, then kill yourself... Forget your moral scruples or intellectual fears! What scruples or fears inﬂuence the workings of life? What chemical scruples rule the driving impulse Of sap, the blood’s circulation, and love? What memory of others exists in the joyous rhythm of life? Ah, vanity of ﬂesh and blood called man, Can’t you see that you’re utterly unimportant? You’re important to yourself, because you’re what you feel. You’re everything to yourself, because for you you’re the universe, The real universe and other people Being mere satellites of your objective subjectivity. You matter to yourself, because you’re all that matters to you. And if this is true for you, O myth, then won’t it be true for others? Do you, like Hamlet, dread the unknown? But what is known? What do you really know Such that you can call anything “unknown”? Do you, like Falstaff, love life with all its fat? If you love it so materially, then love it even more materially By becoming a bodily part of the earth and of things! Scatter yourself, O physicochemical system Of nocturnally conscious cells, Over the nocturnal consciousness of the unconsciousness of bodies, Over the huge blanket of appearances that blankets nothing, Over the grass and weeds of proliferating beings, Over the atomic fog of things, Over the whirling walls Of the dynamic void that’s the world...

I’ll spend the night in Sintra since I can’t spend it in Lisbon, But when I get to Sintra I’ll be sorry I didn’t stay in Lisbon. Always this irrational, irrelevant, useless fretfulness, Always, always, always This exaggerated mental anxiety over nothing, On the road to Sintra, on the road of dreaming, on the road of life... Responsive to my subconscious movements at the wheel, The borrowed car bounds forward beneath me, with me. As I think about the symbol and turn right, I smile. How many borrowed things I’ve used to go forward in the world! How many borrowed things I’ve driven as if they were mine! Alas, how much I myself am what I’ve borrowed! On the left side of the road there’s a cabin—yes, a cabin. On the right the open country, with the moon in the distance. The car, which so recently seemed to be giving me freedom, Is now something that closes me in, Something I can only drive if I’m closed inside it, Something I control only if I’m part of it, if it’s part of me. Behind me on the left the humble—more than humble— cabin... Life there must be happy, just because it isn’t mine. If anyone saw me from the cabin window, they’re no doubt thinking: That guy is happy. Perhaps to the child peering out the top-ﬂoor window I looked (with my borrowed car) like a dream, a magical being come to life. Perhaps to the girl, who as soon as she heard the motor looked out the kitchen window On the ground ﬂoor, I’m something like the prince of every girl’s heart, And she’ll keep glancing through the window until I vanish around the curve. Will I leave dreams behind me, or is it the car that leaves them? I the driver of the borrowed car, or the borrowed car I’m driving? On the road to Sintra in the moonlight, in sadness, with ﬁelds and the night before me, Driving the borrowed Chevrolet and feeling forlorn, I lose myself on the road to come, I vanish in the distance I’m covering, And on a sudden, frantic, violent, inexplicable impulse I accelerate... But my heart is still back at that heap of stones I skirted when I saw it without seeing it, At the door of the cabin, My empty heart, My dissatisﬁed heart, My heart that’s more human than I, more exact than life. On the road to Sintra, close to midnight, in the moonlight, at the wheel, On the road to Sintra, exhausted just from imagining, On the road to Sintra, ever closer to Sintra, On the road to Sintra, ever farther from myself...

What tremendous happiness not to be me! But don’t others feel the same way? What others? There are no others. What others feel is a home with shut windows, And when they’re opened It’s for their children to play on the railed balcony, Among the pots with I don’t know what sort of ﬂowers.

The day before a journey, rrrrrring... I don’t need such a shrill reminder! I want to enjoy the repose of the station that’s my soul Before I see the iron arrival of the deﬁnitive train Approaching in my direction, Before I feel the actual departure in the throat of my stomach, Before I climb aboard, with feet That have never learned to control their emotion when it’s time to depart. Right now, as I smoke in the way station of today, I feel like still relishing a bit of the old life. A useless life that’s best left behind, that’s a prison? What of it? All the universe is a prison, and a prisoner is a prisoner whatever size his cell. My cigarette tastes like impending nausea. The train has already left the other station... Good-bye, good-bye everyone who didn’t come to see me off, Good-bye my abstract and impossible family! Good-bye to today! Good-bye, way station of today! Good-bye, life, good-bye! To remain like a labeled package someone forgot, In a corner of the waiting area on the other side of the tracks. To be found by an employee once the train has departed— “And this? Doesn’t this belong to a fellow who just left?” To remain and merely think of departing, To remain and be right, To remain and die less... I go to the future as to a difﬁcult exam. And if the train never comes and God takes pity on me? I see myself in the station that until now was just a metaphor. I’m a perfectly presentable person. You can tell—they say—that I’ve lived abroad. I have the manners of an obviously well-bred man. I grab my suitcase, rejecting the porter like a harmful vice, And both hand and suitcase tremble. To depart! I’ll never return, I’ll never return because there is no return. The place one returns to is always different, The station one returns to is never the same.

I feel sympathy for people like him, Especially when they don’t deserve sympathy. Yes, I too am a beggar and a bum, And likewise through no one’s fault but my own. To be a beggar and a bum doesn’t mean you’re a beggar and a bum: It means you’re unconnected to the social ladder, It means you’re unadaptable to life’s norms, To life’s real or sentimental norms— It means you’re not a High Court judge, a nine to ﬁve employee, or a whore, Not genuinely poor or an exploited worker, Not sick with an incurable disease, Not thirsty for justice, or a cavalry ofﬁcer, Not, in short, within any of those social categories depicted by novelists Who pour themselves out on paper because they have good reasons for shedding tears And who rebel against society because their good reasons make them think they’re rebels. No: anything but having good reasons! Anything but caring about humanity! Anything but giving in to humanitarianism! What good is a feeling if there’s an external reason for it? Yes, being a beggar and a bum like me Isn’t just being a beggar and a bum, which is commonplace; It’s being a bum by virtue of being isolated in your soul, It’s being a beggar because you have to beg the days to go by and leave you alone. All the rest is stupid, like Dostoyevsky or Gorky. All the rest is going hungry or having no clothes. And even if this happens, it happens to so many people That it’s not worth the trouble to trouble over those it happens to. I’m a beggar and a bum in the truest sense, namely the ﬁgurative sense, And I’m wallowing in heartfelt compassion for myself. Poor Álvaro de Campos! So isolated in life! So depressed! Poor guy, sunken in the armchair of his melancholy! Poor guy, who this very day, with (genuine) tears in his eyes And with a broad, liberal, Muscovite gesture, Gave all he had—from the pocket where he had little— To that poor man who wasn’t poor, who had professionally sad eyes. Poor Álvaro de Campos, whom nobody cares about! Poor Álvaro, who feels so sorry for himself! Yes, the poor guy! Poorer than many who are bums and bum around Or who are beggars and beg, Because the human soul is an abyss. I should know. Poor guy! How splendid to be able to rebel at rallies in my soul! But I’m no fool! And I don’t have the excuse of being socially concerned. I have no excuse at all: I’m lucid. Don’t try to persuade me otherwise: I’m lucid. It’s like I said: I’m lucid.

What an idyllic life this would be for somebody else, With this monotonous buzz or rustle of nothing Beneath the star-studded sky, With the barking of dogs punctuating the vast stillness! I came to rest up, But I forgot to leave myself at home. I brought along the deep-seated thorn of consciousness, The vague nausea, the ill-deﬁned afﬂiction of self-awareness.

Your slender hands, somewhat pale and somewhat my own, Lay perfectly still in your lap that day, As the scissors and thimble of another girl might lie.

You consciously looked at me and said: “It’s a pity every day can’t be like this.” Like that day that wasn’t anything... Ah, you didn’t know, Fortunately you didn’t know, That the pity is that all days are like this, like this... The pity is that, happily or unhappily, The soul must enjoy or suffer the profound tedium of everything, Consciously or unconsciously, Thinking or not yet thinking... That is the pity...

1,poem_2,from SLANTING RAIN I My dream of an inﬁnite port crosses this landscape And in the ﬂowers colors I see the sails of large ships Casting off from the wharf dragging the silhouettes of these old Sunlit trees as their shadows over the waters The port I dream of is somber and pallid And the landscape is sunny viewed from this side But in my mind today s sun is a somber port And the ships leaving the port are these sunlit trees Freed into two I slid straight down the landscape The substance of the wharf is the clear and calm road That rises going up like a wall And the ships pass through the trunks of the trees In a vertically horizontal fashion Dropping their lines in the water through the leaves one by one I don t know who I dream I am Suddenly all the seawater in the port is transparent And I see on the bottom like a huge print unrolled across it This entire landscape a row of trees a road glowing in that port And the shadow of a sailing ship older than the port and passing Between my dream of the port and my looking at this landscape And it approaches me enters me And passes to the other side of my soul III The Great Sphinx of Egypt dreams inside this sheet of paper I write and she appears to me through my transparent hand And the pyramids rise up in a corner of the paper I write and I m startled to see that the nib of my pen Is the proﬁle of King Cheops I freeze Everything goes dark I fall into an abyss made of time I m buried under the pyramids writing verses by the bright light of this lamp And the whole of Egypt presses down on me through the strokes I make with my pen I hear the Sphinx laughing to herself The sound of my pen running over the paper An enormous hand passing through my not being able to see her Sweeps everything into the corner of the ceiling that s behind me And on the paper where I write between it and the pen that s writing Lies the corpse of King Cheops looking at me with wide open eyes And between our gazing at each other ﬂows the Nile And a gaiety of ﬂag bedecked ships meanders In a hazy diagonal line Between me and what I m thinking Funeral of King Cheops in old gold and Me V Outside a whirlwind of sun the horses of the merry go round Within me a static dance of trees stones and hills Absolute night in the brightly lit fair moonlight on the sunny day outside And the fair s many lights make noises out of the garden walls Groups of girls with jugs on their heads Passing by outside and drenched by the sun Cut across thick crowds of people at the fair People mixed up with the lights of the stands with the night and the moonlight And the two groups meet and blend Until they form just one which is both The fair the fair lights the people at the fair And the night that seizes the fair and lifts it into the air Are above the tops of the trees drenched by the sun They re visible beneath the rocks that gleam in the sun They pop out from behind the jugs carried on the girls heads And the whole of this spring landscape is the moon above the fair And the whole fair with its sounds and lights is the ground of this sunny day Suddenly someone shakes this twofold hour as if in a sieve And the powder of the two realities mixed together falls On my hands full of drawings of ports Where huge sailing ships are casting off with no intention of returning Powder of white and black gold on my ﬁngers My hands are the steps of that girl leaving the fair Alone and contented like this day,"from SLANTING RAIN I My dream of an inﬁnite port crosses this landscape And in the ﬂowers’ colors I see the sails of large ships Casting off from the wharf, dragging the silhouettes of these old Sunlit trees as their shadows over the waters... The port I dream of is somber and pallid, And the landscape is sunny viewed from this side... But in my mind today’s sun is a somber port And the ships leaving the port are these sunlit trees... Freed into two, I slid straight down the landscape... The substance of the wharf is the clear and calm road That rises, going up like a wall, And the ships pass through the trunks of the trees In a vertically horizontal fashion, Dropping their lines in the water through the leaves one by one... I don’t know who I dream I am . . . Suddenly all the seawater in the port is transparent And I see on the bottom, like a huge print unrolled across it, This entire landscape, a row of trees, a road glowing in that port, And the shadow of a sailing ship older than the port and passing Between my dream of the port and my looking at this landscape, And it approaches me, enters me, And passes to the other side of my soul... III The Great Sphinx of Egypt dreams inside this sheet of paper... I write—and she appears to me through my transparent hand And the pyramids rise up in a corner of the paper... I write—and I’m startled to see that the nib of my pen Is the proﬁle of King Cheops... I freeze... Everything goes dark . . . I fall into an abyss made of time... I’m buried under the pyramids writing verses by the bright light of this lamp And the whole of Egypt presses down on me through the strokes I make with my pen... I hear the Sphinx laughing to herself The sound of my pen running over the paper . . . An enormous hand, passing through my not being able to see her, Sweeps everything into the corner of the ceiling that’s behind me, And on the paper where I write, between it and the pen that’s writing, Lies the corpse of King Cheops, looking at me with wide-open eyes, And between our gazing at each other ﬂows the Nile, And a gaiety of ﬂag-bedecked ships meanders In a hazy diagonal line Between me and what I’m thinking... Funeral of King Cheops in old gold and Me!... V Outside a whirlwind of sun the horses of the merry-go- round... Within me a static dance of trees, stones and hills... Absolute night in the brightly lit fair, moonlight on the sunny day outside, And the fair’s many lights make noises out of the garden walls... Groups of girls with jugs on their heads Passing by outside and drenched by the sun Cut across thick crowds of people at the fair, People mixed up with the lights of the stands, with the night and the moonlight, And the two groups meet and blend Until they form just one which is both... The fair, the fair lights, the people at the fair And the night that seizes the fair and lifts it into the air Are above the tops of the trees drenched by the sun, They’re visible beneath the rocks that gleam in the sun, They pop out from behind the jugs carried on the girls’ heads, And the whole of this spring landscape is the moon above the fair, And the whole fair, with its sounds and lights, is the ground of this sunny day . . . Suddenly someone shakes this twofold hour as if in a sieve, And the powder of the two realities, mixed together, falls On my hands full of drawings of ports Where huge sailing ships are casting off with no intention of returning... Powder of white and black gold on my ﬁngers... My hands are the steps of that girl leaving the fair, Alone and contented like this day...

You knew me a long time ago. I was that sad child you didn’t care for But then gradually got to be interested in (In his anguish, his sadness, and something else) And ended up liking, almost without realizing it. Remember? The sad Child who played on the beach By himself, quietly, far away from the others, And he sometimes looked over at them sadly but without regret... I see that you occasionally steal a glance at me. Do you remember? Do you want to see if you remember? Ah, I understand... Don’t you still sense in my sad and calm face The sad child who always played far away from the others And sometimes looked at them with sad eyes but without regret? I know you’re watching and don’t understand what sadness it is That makes me look sad. It isn’t regret or nostalgia, disappointment or resentment. No...It’s the sadness Of one who, in the great prenatal realm, Must have received from God the Secret— The secret of the world’s illusion, Of the absolute emptiness of things— The incurable sadness Of one who realizes that everything’s pointless, worthless, That effort is an absurd waste, And that life is a void, Since disillusion always follows on the heels of illusion And Death seems to be the meaning of Life... It’s this, but not only this, that you see in my face And that makes you steal an occasional glance at me. There is, besides this, That grim astonishment, that black chill, Which comes from the soul Having been told a secret of God In the prenatal realm, when life Had still shown no sign of dawning And the whole of the complex, luminous Universe Was an inevitable destiny yet to be fulﬁlled. If this doesn’t deﬁne me, nothing deﬁnes me. And this doesn’t deﬁne me— Because the Secret that God told me wasn’t only this. There was something else, which led to my embracing The unreal dimension, my delighting in it so much, my knack For grasping the ungraspable and for feeling what can’t be felt, My inward dignity of an emperor, though I have no empire, My world of dreams fashioned in broad daylight... Yes, that is what gives My face an oldness even older than my childhood, And my gaze an anxiety within my happiness.

Ah, how much of my past Was only the false life Of a future I imagined! Here on the bank of the river I grow calm for no reason.

Any child’s ball Rises higher than my hope, Rolls farther than my longing. Waves of the river, so slight That you aren’t even waves, The hours, days and years Pass quickly—mere grass or snow Which die by the same sun. I spent all I didn’t have. I’m older than I am. The illusion that kept me going Was a queen only on stage: Once undressed, her reign was over. Soft sound of these slow waters Aching for shores you’ve passed, How drowsy are the memories Of misty hopes! What dreams All dreaming and life amount to! What did I make of my life? I found myself when already lost. Impatient, I let myself be, As I might let a lunatic go on Believing what I’d proved was wrong. Dead sound of these gentle waters That ﬂow because they must, Take not only my memories But also my dead hopes— Dead, because they must die. I’m already my future corpse.

13,poem_14,UN SOIR À LIMA The voice on the radio returns Announcing in an exaggerated drawl And now Un Soir à Lima I stop smiling My heart stops beating And from the unconscious receiver That sweet and accursed melody Breaks forth My soul loses itself In a suddenly resurrected memory The wooded slope shimmered Under the great African moon The living room in our house was large and everything Between it and the sea was lit up By the dark brilliance of that gigantic moon But only I stood by the window My mother was at the piano And played That very same Un Soir à Lima My God how distant and irrevocably lost all that is What has become of her noble bearing Of her dependably soothing voice Of her full and affectionate smile What there is today To remind me of all that is this melody Our melody Still playing on the radio None other than Un Soir à Lima Her graying hair was so lovely In the light And I never thought she would die And leave me at the mercy of who I am She died but I ll always be her little boy Because no one for his mother is ever a man And even through tears my memory Still preserves The perfect medallion image Of that yet more perfect proﬁle My forever childish heart weeps When I remember you mother so Roman and already graying I see your ﬁngers at the keyboard and the moonlight Outside shines eternally in me In my heart you play without ceasing Un Soir à Lima Did the little ones go right to sleep Yes right to sleep This girl here is almost asleep And smiling as you spoke you continued Playing Attentively playing Un Soir à Lima All I was when I wasn t anyone All I loved and only now know I loved now that I have no remotely Real path now that I have only Nostalgia for what was It all lives in me Through lights and music And my heart s undying vision Of that eternal hour In which you turned The unreal page of music And I heard and saw you Continue the eternal melody That lives today In the eternal depths of my nostalgia For the time when you mother played Un Soir à Lima And the indifferent receiver Transmits from the unconscious station Un Soir à Lima I didn t know then that I was happy I know it now because I no longer am This girl here is also sleeping No she isn t We all smiled And I Far from the hard and lonely Moon that shone outside Absentmindedly kept listening To what made me dream without realizing it To what nowadays makes me feel sorry for myself That gentle song without voice just the sounds Of the keys my mother played Un Soir à Lima If only I could have that entire scene Right here complete and distilled Tucked away in a drawer Tucked in one of my pockets If only I could yank From space from time from life That living room that hour The whole family and that peace and that music Isolating it all In some part of my soul Where I could have it Forever Alive warm As real as it is back there Even now When mother dear mother you played Un Soir à Lima Mother mother I was your boy Whom you taught to be So well behaved And today I m a rag Rolled into a ball by Destiny and tossed Into a corner There I pathetically lie But the memory of what I heard and what I knew Of affection of home and of family Rises to my heart in a swirl And remembering it I heard today my God all alone Un Soir à Lima Where is that hour that home that love From when mother dear mother you played Un Soir à Lima And my sister Tiny and snuggled up in a stuffed chair Didn t know If she was sleeping or not I ve been so many vile things I ve been so unfaithful to who I am How often my parched Subtle reasoner s spirit Has abundantly erred How often even my emotion Has unfeelingly deceived me Since I have no home I at least dwell In this vision Of the home I had then I at least listen listen listen There by the window Of never again ceasing to feel In that living room our warm living room In capacious Africa where the moon Outside shines vast and indifferent Neither good nor bad And where mother In my heart mother You visibly play You eternally play Un Soir à Lima My stepfather What a man what heart and soul Reclined his calm and robust Athlete s body In the largest chair And listened smoking and musing His blue eyes without any color And my sister then a child Curled up in her chair Heard while sleeping And smiling That someone was playing Perhaps a dance And I standing before the window Saw all the

Listening to my mother play Listening now with the salt of tears on my tongue to Un Soir à Lima The veil of tears does not blind me Crying I see What that music gives me The mother I had that home

watch my mother play Those small white hands Whose caresses will never again comfort me Play on the piano carefully and calmly Un Soir à Lima Ah I see everything clearly I m back there once more I turn away my eyes that had been gazing At the uncommon moon outside But wait my mind rambles and the music is over I ramble as I ve always rambled With no inner certainty about who I am Nor any real faith or ﬁrm rule I ramble I create my own eternities With the opium of memory and abandon I enthrone fantastical queens But have no throne for them to sit on I dream because I wallow In the unreal river of that recollected music My soul is a ragged child Sleeping in a dusky corner All I have of my own In true waking reality Are the tatters of my abandoned soul And my head that s dreaming next to the wall Oh isn t there mother dear mother Some God to save all this from futility Some other world in which this lives on I continue to ramble everything is illusion Un Soir à Lima Shatter heart,"UN SOIR À LIMA The voice on the radio returns, Announcing in an exaggerated drawl: “And now Un Soir à Lima ...” I stop smiling... My heart stops beating... And from the unconscious receiver That sweet and accursed melody Breaks forth... My soul loses itself In a suddenly resurrected memory... The wooded slope shimmered Under the great African moon. The living room in our house was large, and everything Between it and the sea was lit up By the dark brilliance of that gigantic moon... But only I stood by the window. My mother was at the piano And played... That very same Un Soir à Lima. My God, how distant and irrevocably lost all that is! What has become of her noble bearing? Of her dependably soothing voice? Of her full and affectionate smile? What there is today To remind me of all that is this melody, Our melody, Still playing on the radio, None other than Un Soir à Lima. Her graying hair was so lovely In the light, And I never thought she would die And leave me at the mercy of who I am! She died, but I’ll always be her little boy, Because no one, for his mother, is ever a man! ◆ And even through tears my memory Still preserves The perfect medallion image Of that yet more perfect proﬁle. My forever childish heart weeps When I remember you, mother, so Roman and already graying. I see your ﬁngers at the keyboard, and the moonlight Outside shines eternally in me. In my heart you play, without ceasing, Un Soir à Lima. ... “Did the little ones go right to sleep?” “Yes, right to sleep.” “This girl here is almost asleep.” And, smiling as you spoke, you continued Playing, Attentively playing, Un Soir à Lima. All I was when I wasn’t anyone, All I loved and only now know I loved, now that I have no remotely Real path, now that I have only Nostalgia for what was— It all lives in me Through lights and music And my heart’s undying vision Of that eternal hour In which you turned The unreal page of music And I heard and saw you Continue the eternal melody That lives today In the eternal depths of my nostalgia For the time when you, mother, played Un Soir à Lima. And the indifferent receiver Transmits from the unconscious station Un Soir à Lima. I didn’t know then that I was happy. I know it now, because I no longer am. “This girl here is also sleeping...” “No she isn’t.” We all smiled, And I, Far from the hard and lonely Moon that shone outside, Absentmindedly kept listening To what made me dream without realizing it, To what nowadays makes me feel sorry for myself, That gentle song without voice, just the sounds Of the keys my mother played: Un Soir à Lima. ◆ If only I could have that entire scene Right here, complete and distilled, Tucked away in a drawer, Tucked in one of my pockets! If only I could yank From space, from time, from life, That living room, that hour, The whole family and that peace and that music, Isolating it all In some part of my soul Where I could have it Forever Alive, warm, As real as it is back there Even now, When, mother, dear mother, you played Un Soir à Lima. Mother, mother, I was your boy Whom you taught to be So well-behaved, And today I’m a rag Rolled into a ball by Destiny and tossed Into a corner. There I pathetically lie, But the memory of what I heard and what I knew Of affection, of home and of family Rises to my heart in a swirl, And remembering it I heard, today, my God, all alone, Un Soir à Lima. Where is that hour, that home, that love From when, mother, dear mother, you played Un Soir à Lima? And my sister, Tiny and snuggled up in a stuffed chair, Didn’t know If she was sleeping or not... ◆ I’ve been so many vile things! I’ve been so unfaithful to who I am! How often my parched, Subtle reasoner’s spirit Has abundantly erred! How often even my emotion Has unfeelingly deceived me! Since I have no home,  I at least dwell In this vision Of the home I had then.  I at least listen, listen, listen, There by the window Of never again ceasing to feel, In that living room, our warm living room In capacious Africa where the moon Outside shines vast and indifferent, Neither good nor bad, And where, mother, In my heart, mother, You visibly play, You eternally play Un Soir à Lima. ... ◆ My stepfather (What a man! what heart and soul!) Reclined his calm and robust Athlete’s body In the largest chair And listened, smoking and musing, His blue eyes without any color. And my sister, then a child, Curled up in her chair, Heard while sleeping And smiling That someone was playing Perhaps a dance... And I, standing before the window, Saw all the moonlight of all Africa ﬂooding The landscape and my dream. Where did all of that go? Un Soir à Lima ... Shatter, heart! ... ◆ ... But I’m dizzy. I don’t know if I’m seeing or if I’m sleeping, If I am who I was, If I’m remembering or if I’m forgetting. Something hazily ﬂows Between who I am and what I was, And it’s like a river, or a breeze, or a dreaming, Something unexpected That suddenly stops, And from the depths where it seemed it would end There emerges, more and more clearly, In a nimbus of softness and nostalgia Where my heart still lingers, A piano, a woman’s ﬁgure, a longing... I sleep in the lap of that melody, Listening to my mother play, Listening, now with the salt of tears on my tongue, to Un Soir à Lima. ◆ The veil of tears does not blind me. Crying, I see What that music gives me— The mother I had, that home from long ago, The child I was, The horror of time because it ﬂows, The horror of life because it only kills. I see, and fall asleep, And in my torpor, having forgotten I still exist in the world of today, I watch my mother play. Those small white hands, Whose caresses will never again comfort me, Play on the piano, carefully and calmly, Un Soir à Lima. Ah, I see everything clearly! I’m back there once more. I turn away my eyes that had been gazing At the uncommon moon outside. But wait, my mind rambles, and the music is over... I ramble as I’ve always rambled, With no inner certainty about who I am, Nor any real faith or ﬁrm rule. I ramble, I create my own eternities With the opium of memory and abandon. I enthrone fantastical queens But have no throne for them to sit on. I dream because I wallow In the unreal river of that recollected music. My soul is a ragged child Sleeping in a dusky corner. All I have of my own In true, waking reality Are the tatters of my abandoned soul And my head that’s dreaming next to the wall. Oh isn’t there, mother, dear mother, Some God to save all this from futility, Some other world in which this lives on? I continue to ramble: everything is illusion. Un Soir à Lima ...

Then we could raise a strong plate of yellow metal, and there lay a beautiful, illustrious body, whole and uncorrupted ..., and in his hand he held a small parchment book, written in gold and entitled T., which, after the Bible, is our greatest trea- sure, one that should not be lightly submitted to the world’s censure. Fama Fraternitatis Roseae Crucis I When, awakened from this sleep called life, We ﬁnd out what we are and what This fall into Body was, this descent Into the Night that obstructs our Soul, Will we ﬁnally know the hidden Truth about all that exists or ﬂows? No: not even the freed Soul knows it. Nor does God, who created us, contain it. God is the man of a yet higher God. A Supreme Adam, He also fell. Our Creator, He was also created, And was cut off from the Truth. The Abyss, His Spirit, hides it from Him in the beyond. In the World, His Body, it doesn’t exist. II Before all that there was the Word, here lost When the already extinguished Inﬁnite Light Was raised from Chaos, the ground of Being, Into Shadow, and the absent Word was obscured. But though it feels its form is wrong, the Soul sees At last in itself—mere Shadow—the glowing Word of this World, human and anointed, The Perfect Rose, cruciﬁed in God. Lords, then, on the threshold of the Heavens, We may search beyond God for the Secret Of our Master and the higher Good; Wakened from here and from ourselves, we’re freed At last in Christ’s present blood from worshiping The God who makes the created World die. III Ah, but here where we still wander, unreal, We sleep what we are, and although in dreams We may at last see the truth, we see it (Since our seeing is a dream) distortedly. Shadows seeking bodies, how will we feel Their reality if we ﬁnd them? What, as Shadows, can we touch with our shadowy Hands? Our touch is absence and vacancy. Who will free us from this closed Soul? We can hear, if not see, beyond the hall Of being, but how make the door swing open? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
