 I want the ﬂower you are, not the one you give. Why refuse me what I don’t ask of you? You’ll have time to refuse After you’ve given. Flower, be a ﬂower to me! If, ungenerous, you’re plucked By the hand of the ill-omened sphinx, you’ll wander forever As an absurd shadow, Seeking what you never gave.
