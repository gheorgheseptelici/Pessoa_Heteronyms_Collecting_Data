The god Pan isn’t dead. In each ﬁeld that shows Ceres’ naked breasts To the smiles of Apollo, Sooner or later You will see the god Pan, Immortal, appear. The Christians’ sad god Killed none of the others. Christ is one more god, One that was perhaps missing. Pan still offers The sounds of his ﬂute To the ears of Ceres Reclining in the ﬁelds. The gods are the same, Always clear and calm, Full of eternity And disdain for us, Bringing day and night And golden harvests Not in order to give us Day and night and wheat But for some other, divine And incidental purpose.
