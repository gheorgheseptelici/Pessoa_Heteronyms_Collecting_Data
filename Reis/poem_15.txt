I suffer, Lydia, from the fear of destiny. Any tiny thing that might Give rise to a new order in my life Frightens me, Lydia. Anything whatsoever that changes The smooth course of my existence, Though it change it for something better, Because it means change, I hate and don’t want.  the gods Allow my life to be a continuous, Perfectly ﬂat plain, running To where it ends. Though I never taste glory and never Receive love or due respect from others, It will sufﬁce that life be only life And that I live it.
