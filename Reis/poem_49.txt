Each day you didn’t enjoy wasn’t yours: You just got through it. Whatever you live Without enjoying, you don’t live. You don’t have to love or drink or smile. The sun’s reﬂection in a puddle of water Is enough, if it pleases you. Happy those who, placing their delight In slight things, are never deprived Of each day’s natural fortune!
