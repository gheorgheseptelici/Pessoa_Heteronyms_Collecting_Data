 Youll become only who you always were What the gods give they give at the start Only once does Fate give you Your fate for youre but one Little is attained by the effort you exert In accord with your native ability Little if you were not Conceived for more Be glad to be who you cannot resist Being You will still have the vast Sky to cover you and the earth Green or dry given the season
