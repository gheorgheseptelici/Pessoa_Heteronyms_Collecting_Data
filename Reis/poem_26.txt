 Now plowing his scant ﬁeld, now solemnly Beholding it as if he were beholding A son, this man enjoys, uncertainly, The unreﬂected life. Changes occurring in the false borders Do not thwart his plow, nor is he Troubled by whatever councils govern The fate of patient peoples. Little more in the present of the future Than the grass he pulled up, he lives securely His old life that won’t return but endures, Sons, different and his own.
