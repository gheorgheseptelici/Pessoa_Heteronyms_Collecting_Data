To Alberto Caeiro Peaceful Master Are all the hours We lose if we place As in a vase Flowers on our Losing them There are in our life No sorrows or joys So let us learn Wisely unworried Not how to live life But to let it go by Keeping forever Peaceful and calm Taking children For our teachers And letting Nature Fill our eyes Along the river Or along the road Wherever we are Always remaining In the same easy Repose of living Time passes And tells us nothing We grow old Let us know how With a certain mischief To feel ourselves go Taking action Serves no purpose No one can resist The atrocious god Who always devours His own children Let us pick ﬂowers Let us lightly Wet our hands In the calm rivers So as to learn Some of their calmness Sunﬂowers forever Beholding the sun We will serenely Depart from life Without even the regret Of having lived
