Securely I sit on the steadfast column Of the verses in which I’ll remain, Not fearing the endless future inﬂux Of times and of oblivion, For when the mind intently studies In itself the world’s reﬂections, It becomes their plasma, and the world is what Creates art, not the mind. Thus On the plaque the outer moment engraves Its being, and there endures. [ ]
