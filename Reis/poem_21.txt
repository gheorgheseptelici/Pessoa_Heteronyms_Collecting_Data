I don’t want the presents which, Contrary to your intention, are The very denial of what you give. You give me what I’ll lose, Weeping its loss twice over, As something of you and of me. Promise it instead, without giving Me anything, since then the loss Will occur in my hopes More than in my memory. My only displeasure will be The continual one of living, Since the days pass and what’s hoped for Still doesn’t come, and it’s nothing.
