To nothing can your hands, now things, appeal, Nor can your now stiff lips persuade, In the oppressive depths Of damp, inﬂicted earth. Perhaps just the smile from when you loved Embalms you, far away, and in our memories Lifts you to what you were, Today a rotten hive. And the useless name that your dead body Used, like a soul, when alive on earth Is forgotten. This ode engraves An anonymous smile.
