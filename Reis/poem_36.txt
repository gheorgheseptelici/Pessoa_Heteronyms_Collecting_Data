 The ﬂeeting track made by the vanished foot In the soft grass, the echo that hollowly rolls, The shadow that grows blacker, The whiteness a ship leaves in its wake— So too the soul, no greater or better, quits souls; What’s passed leaves what’s passing. Memory forgets. Once dead, we keep dying. Lydia, we exist for ourselves.
