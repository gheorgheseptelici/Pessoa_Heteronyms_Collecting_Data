Each thing, in its time, has its time. The trees do not blossom in winter, Nor does the white cold Cover the ﬁelds in spring. The heat that the day required of us Belongs not to the night that’s falling, Lydia. Let’s love with greater calm Our uncertain life. Sitting by the ﬁre, weary not from our work But because it’s the hour for weariness, Let’s not force our voice To be more than a secret. And may our words of reminiscence (Which is all the sun’s black departure brings us) Be spoken at intervals, Haphazardly. Let’s remember the past by degrees, And may the stories told back then, Now twice-told stories, Speak to us Of the ﬂowers that in our distant childhood We picked with another kind of pleasure And another consciousness As we gazed at the world. And so, Lydia, sitting there by the ﬁre As if there forever, like household gods, Let’s mend the past As if mending clothes In the disquiet that repose must bring to our lives When all we do is think of what We were, and outside There’s just night.
