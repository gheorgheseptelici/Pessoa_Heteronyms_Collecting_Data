Each man fulﬁlls the destiny he must fulﬁll And desires the destiny he desires He neither fulﬁlls what he desires Nor desires what he fulﬁlls Like stones that border ﬂower beds We are arranged by Fate and there remain Our lot having placed us Where we had to be placed Lets have no better knowledge of what Was our due than that it was our due Lets fulﬁll what we are Nothing more are we given
