The only freedom the gods grant us Is this: to submit Of our own free will to their sovereignty. We should do just that, Since only in the illusion of freedom Does freedom exist. It is what the gods, subject To eternal fate, do To maintain their calm and unwavering Ancient conviction That their life is divine and free. Imitating the gods, Who are no freer on Olympus than we are, Letâ€™s build our lives Like those who build castles of sand To delight their eyes, And the gods will know how to thank us For being so like them.
