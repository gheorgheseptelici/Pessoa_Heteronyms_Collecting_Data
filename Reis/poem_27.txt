Don’t try to build in the space you suppose Is future, Lydia, and don’t promise yourself Tomorrow. Quit hoping and be who you are Today. You alone are your life. Don’t plot your destiny, for you are not future. Between the cup you empty and the same cup Reﬁlled, who knows whether your fortune Won’t interpose the abyss? [?]
