Lost from the way, you clutch your sterile, Toilsome days in bundles of hard wood And think you are living Life without illusions. Your wood is only weight you carry To where you’ll have no ﬁre to warm you, Nor will the shades we become Endure weight on their shoulders. To rest up you don’t rest; and if you pass Something on, pass not wealth but the example Of how a brief life is enough, Brief and not too hard. We use little of the little we scarcely have. Work tires, and the gold isn’t ours. Our own fame laughs at us, For we won’t see it When, brought down by the Fates, suddenly We’ll be ancient and solemn ﬁgures, Ever more shadowy, Until the fatal meeting— The dark boat on the gloomy river, And the nine embraces of Stygian cold, And the insatiable lap Of the land of Pluto.
