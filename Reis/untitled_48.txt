 Calm because Im unknown And myself because Im calm I want to Ô¨Åll my days With wanting nothing from them For those whom wealth touches Gold irritates the skin For those on whom fame blows Life fogs over On those for whom happiness Is their sun night will fall But those who hope for nothing Are glad for whatever comes
