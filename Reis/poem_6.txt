Snow covers the sunlit hills in the distance, But the tranquil cold that smoothes and whets The darts of the high sun Is already mild. Today, Neaera, let us not hide: Since we are nothing, we lack nothing. We hope for nothing And feel cold in the sun. But such as it is, let us enjoy This moment, somewhat solemn in our joy, While waiting for death As for something we know.
