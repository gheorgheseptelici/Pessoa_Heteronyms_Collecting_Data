 A verse repeating A cool breeze, Summer in the ﬁelds, And the soul’s courtyard Vacant and sunlit... Or, in winter, the snowy Summits in the distance, The ﬁreside where we sit Singing tales handed down, And a poem to tell all this... The gods grant Few pleasures beyond These, which are nothing. But they also grant That we want no others.
