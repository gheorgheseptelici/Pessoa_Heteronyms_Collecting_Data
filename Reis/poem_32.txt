 Dreamed pleasure is pleasure, albeit in a dream. What we suppose of ourselves we become, If with a focused mind We persist in believing it. So do not censure my way of thinking About things, beings, and fate. For myself I create as much As I create for myself. Outside me, indifferent to what I think, Fate is fulﬁlled. But I fulﬁll myself Within the small ambit Of what is given to me as mine.
