Remember, with quick steps, on the white beach Darkened by the foam, the ancient rhythm That bare feet know, That rhythm repeated By nymphs when they tap the sound of the dance In the shade of the trees; you, children Not yet concerned With concerns, revive That noisy circle while Apollo bends, Like a high branch, the blue curve he gilds, And the tide, high or low, Flows without ceasing.
