 How many enjoy the enjoyment of enjoying Without enjoying their enjoyment, and divide it Between themselves and others Taking note of their enjoyment. Ah, Lydia, forego the trappings of enjoyment, For we have but one enjoyment; we cannot Give it to others as a prize For noticing that we enjoy. Each of us is only our self, and to enjoy With others is to enjoy them, not enjoy for them. Learn what your body, Your boundary, teaches you.
