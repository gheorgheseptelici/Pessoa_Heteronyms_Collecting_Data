Wise the man who’s content with the world’s spectacle, And who drinks without recalling That he has drunk before, For whom everything is new And forever imperishable. Crown him with vine leaves, ivy or twining Roses. He knows that life Is passing by him and that The shears of Atropos cut The ﬂower and cut him. He knows how to hide this with the color of the wine And to erase the taste of time With its orgiastic ﬂavor, The way a weeping voice is hushed When the bacchantes pass by. And he waits, a calm drinker and almost happy, Only desiring With a desire scarcely felt That the abominable wave Not wet him too soon.
