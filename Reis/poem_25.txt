How short a time is the longest life And our youth in it! Ah Chloe, Chloe, If I don’t love, don’t drink And don’t instinctively not think, The unmovable law weighs on me, Time’s endless, imposed hours afﬂict me, And to my ears comes The sound of the rushes On the hidden shore where the cold lilies Of the nether ﬁelds grow and the current Knows not where the day is, A groaning murmur.
