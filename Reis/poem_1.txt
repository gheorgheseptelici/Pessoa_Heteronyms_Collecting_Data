To Alberto Caeiro Peaceful, Master, Are all the hours We lose if we place, As in a vase, Flowers on our Losing them. There are in our life No sorrows or joys. So let us learn, Wisely unworried, Not how to live life But to let it go by, Keeping forever Peaceful and calm, Taking children For our teachers And letting Nature Fill our eyes... Along the river Or along the road, Wherever we are, Always remaining In the same, easy Repose of living... Time passes And tells us nothing. We grow old. Let us know how, With a certain mischief, To feel ourselves go. Taking action Serves no purpose. No one can resist The atrocious god Who always devours His own children. Let us pick ﬂowers. Let us lightly Wet our hands In the calm rivers, So as to learn Some of their calmness. Sunﬂowers forever Beholding the sun, We will serenely Depart from life, Without even the regret Of having lived.
