 Not you, Christ, do I hate or reject. In you as in the other, older gods I believe. But for me you are not more Or less than they, just younger. I do hate and calmly abhor those who want To place you above the other gods, your equals. I want you where you are, not higher Nor lower than they—just yourself. A sad god, perhaps necessary since there was none Like you, now yet another in the Pantheon And our faith, no higher or purer, Since for all things there were gods, except you. Take care, exclusive idolater of Christ, for life Is multiple, all days differ from all others, And only if we’re multiple like them Will we be with the truth, and alone.
