 Not just those who envy and hate us Limit and oppress us; those who love us Limit us no less.  the Gods grant me, stripped of all Affections, the cold freedom of the heights Of nothingness. Wanting little, A man has everything. Wanting nothing, He’s free. Not having and not desiring, He’s equal, though man, to the Gods.
