Ad Caeiri manes magistri The new summer that newly brings Apparently new ï¬‚owers renews The ancient green Of the revived leaves No more will the barren abyss which silently Swallows what we hardly are give back To the clear light of day His living presence No more and the progeny to whom his thought Gave the life of reason pleads for him in vain For the Styxs nine keys Lock but do not open He who was like a god among singers Who heard the voices that called from Olympus And hearing listened And understood is now nothing But weave for him still the garlands you weave Whom will you crown if you dont crown him Present them as funerary Offerings with no cult But let not the loam or Hades touch His fame and you whom Ulysses founded You with your seven hills Take maternal pride
