Ad Caeiri manes magistri* The new summer that newly brings Apparently new ﬂowers renews The ancient green Of the revived leaves. No more will the barren abyss, which silently Swallows what we hardly are, give back To the clear light of day His living presence. No more; and the progeny to whom his thought Gave the life of reason, pleads for him in vain, For the Styx’s nine keys Lock but do not open. He who was like a god among singers, Who heard the voices that called from Olympus And, hearing, listened And understood, is now nothing. But weave for him still the garlands you weave. Whom will you crown if you don’t crown him? Present them as funerary Offerings with no cult. But let not the loam or Hades touch His fame; and you, whom Ulysses founded, You, with your seven hills, Take maternal pride, which has seven hills and was founded, according to legend, by Ulysses. Caeiro, according to his “biography,” was born in Lisbon.
