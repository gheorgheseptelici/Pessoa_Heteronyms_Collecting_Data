We’ve always had the conﬁdent vision That other beings, angels or gods, Reign above us And move us to act. Just as in the ﬁelds our actions On the cattle, which they don’t understand, Coerce and compel them Without them knowing why, So too our human will and mind Are the hands by which others lead us To wherever they want us To desire to go.
