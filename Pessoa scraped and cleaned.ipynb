       " 'UN SOIR À LIMA The voice on the radio returns Announcing in an exaggerated drawl And now Un Soir à Lima  I stop smiling My heart stops beating And from the unconscious receiver That sweet and accursed melody Breaks forth My soul loses itself In a suddenly resurrected memory The wooded slope shimmered Under the great African moon The living room in our house was large and everything Between it and the sea was lit up By the dark brilliance of that gigantic moon But only I stood by the window My mother was at the piano And played That very same Un Soir à Lima My God how distant and irrevocably lost all that is What has become of her noble bearing Of her dependably soothing voice Of her full and affectionate smile What there is today To remind me of all that is this melody Our melody Still playing on the radio None other than Un Soir à Lima Her graying hair was so lovely In the light And I never thought she would die And leave me at the mercy of who I am She died but Ill always be her little boy Because no one for his mother is ever a man  And even through tears my memory Still preserves The perfect medallion image Of that yet more perfect proﬁle My forever childish heart weeps When I remember you mother so Roman and already graying I see your ﬁngers at the keyboard and the moonlight Outside shines eternally in me In my heart you play without ceasing Un Soir à Lima  Did the little ones go right to sleep Yes right to sleep This girl here is almost asleep And smiling as you spoke you continued Playing Attentively playing Un Soir à Lima All I was when I wasnt anyone All I loved and only now know I loved now that I have no remotely Real path now that I have only Nostalgia for what was It all lives in me Through lights and music And my hearts undying vision Of that eternal hour In which you turned The unreal page of music And I heard and saw you Continue the eternal melody That lives today In the eternal depths of my nostalgia For the time when you mother played Un Soir à Lima And the indifferent receiver Transmits from the unconscious station Un Soir à Lima I didnt know then that I was happy I know it now because I no longer am This girl here is also sleeping No she isnt We all smiled And I Far from the hard and lonely Moon that shone outside Absentmindedly kept listening To what made me dream without realizing it To what nowadays makes me feel sorry for myself That gentle song without voice just the sounds Of the keys my mother played Un Soir à Lima  If only I could have that entire scene Right here complete and distilled Tucked away in a drawer Tucked in one of my pockets If only I could yank From space from time from life That living room that hour The whole family and that peace and that music Isolating it all In some part of my soul Where I could have it Forever Alive warm As real as it is back there Even now When mother dear mother you played Un Soir à Lima Mother mother I was your boy Whom you taught to be So wellbehaved And today Im a rag Rolled into a ball by Destiny and tossed Into a corner There I pathetically lie But the memory of what I heard and what I knew Of affection of home and of family Rises to my heart in a swirl And remembering it I heard today my God all alone Un Soir à Lima Where is that hour that home that love From when mother dear mother you played Un Soir à Lima And my sister Tiny and snuggled up in a stuffed chair Didnt know If she was sleeping or not  Ive been so many vile things Ive been so unfaithful to who I am How often my parched Subtle reasoners spirit Has abundantly erred How often even my emotion Has unfeelingly deceived me Since I have no home  I at least dwell In this vision Of the home I had then  I at least listen listen listen There by the window Of never again ceasing to feel In that living room our warm living room In capacious Africa where the moon Outside shines vast and indifferent Neither good nor bad And where mother In my heart mother You visibly play You eternally play Un Soir à Lima   My stepfather What a man what heart and soul Reclined his calm and robust Athletes body In the largest chair And listened smoking and musing His blue eyes without any color And my sister then a child Curled up in her chair Heard while sleeping And smiling That someone was playing Perhaps a dance And I standing before the window Saw all the moonlight of all Africa ﬂooding The landscape and my dream Where did all of that go Un Soir à Lima  Shatter heart    But Im dizzy I dont know if Im seeing or if Im sleeping If I am who I was If Im remembering or if Im forgetting Something hazily ﬂows Between who I am and what I was And its like a river or a breeze or a dreaming Something unexpected That suddenly stops And from the depths where it seemed it would end There emerges more and more clearly In a nimbus of softness and nostalgia Where my heart still lingers A piano a womans ﬁgure a longing I sleep in the lap of that melody Listening to my mother play Listening now with the salt of tears on my tongue to Un Soir à Lima  The veil of tears does not blind me Crying I see What that music gives me The mother I had that home from long ago The child I was The horror of time because it ﬂows The horror of life because it only kills I see and fall asleep And in my torpor having forgotten I still exist in the world of today I watch my mother play Those small white hands Whose caresses will never again comfort me Play on the piano carefully and calmly Un Soir à Lima Ah I see everything clearly Im back there once more I turn away my eyes that had been gazing At the uncommon moon outside But wait my mind rambles and the music is over I ramble as Ive always rambled With no inner certainty about who I am Nor any real faith or ﬁrm rule I ramble I create my own eternities With the opium of memory and abandon I enthrone fantastical queens But have no throne for them to sit on I dream because I wallow In the unreal river of that recollected music My soul is a ragged child Sleeping in a dusky corner All I have of my own In true waking reality Are the tatters of my abandoned soul And my head thats dreaming next to the wall Oh isnt there mother dear mother Some God to save all this from futility Some other world in which this lives on I continue to ramble everything is illusion Un Soir à Lima  Shatter heart   ',\n",
